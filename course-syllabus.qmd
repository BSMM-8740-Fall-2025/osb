## Exam/Assignment Descriptions

The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools is strictly prohibited in all course assessments unless explicitly indicated otherwise in guidelines provided by the instructor for an assessment. This includes the use of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude, Jenni, Github Co-pilot, DaLL-E, Midjourney, and all other tools that provide artificial intelligence capabilities. When the use of generative AI is permitted this use must be acknowledged and cited following citation instructions given in the assessment guidelines. Use of generative AI outside of assessment guidelines or without required citation will constitute academic misconduct and may be subject to discipline under Bylaw 31: Academic Integrity. It is the student’s responsibility to be clear concerning constraints on the use of generative AI for each assessment and to comply with these constraints.

### **Quizzes**

## Odette School Of Business Course Policies

Please refer to the Odette School of Business Course Policies document for specific information on the following subjects. This Course Policies document is available electronically on each course website, on the Brightspace Master of Management Program page at <https://brightspace.uwindsor.ca/d2l/le/content/136263/viewContent/654482/View?ou=136263> and also in paper form outside each Area Secretary's office on the 4th floor of the Odette building. (Adopted Fall 2009).

## Master Of Management Program Etiquette

The Master of Management program is a culturally inclusive program where it is expected that students, faculty, and staff will recognize, appreciate, and benefit from diversity so as to enhance the learning experience. Promoting a culturally inclusive learning environment encourages individuals to collaborate and develop intercultural respect. The following outlines the protocol for Master of Management students while they are at the University of Windsor:

-   All students will communicate in English at all times. It is important for students to continually improve language skills and be inclusive of others from different backgrounds. 
-   Students will demonstrate respectful behavior toward their peers and professors, regardless of culture, language, values, beliefs, or ideas.

## Secondary Data Use, Evaluation, Focus Groups And Interviews

This course will be evaluated as part of internal or external quality assurance processes and reporting requirements to funding agencies and as research data for scholarly use. As a student in this course your online student data will be used for evaluating the course delivery and your engagement in the various aspects of the course. This will only occur after final grades have been submitted and approved so it will no effect on your grade. This course data provides information about your individual course usage and activity during the time that you are enrolled in the course. Your anonymized, aggregated data may also be used in the future in reports, articles or presentations.

During the final week of the course you may also be invited to participate in further research about the course. If you decide to participate you may be asked to fill out anonymous online questionnaires that solicit your impressions about the course design and student learning in the course.  The survey participation is voluntary and no questions of a personal nature will be asked. Your participation will have no effect on your grade and your instructor will not know who participated in the surveys.

Finally, at the end of the survey you may also be asked if you want to participate in a focus group or interviews after final grades have been assigned to gather yours and other student opinions about specific course delivery methods and technologies used.

## Commitment To Student Wellness:

Should you need to request alternative accommodation contact your Instructor, Program Administrator, or Director.

## Lectures and labs

The goal of both the lectures and the labs is for them to be as interactive as possible. My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature \[application exercises\] that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.

You are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as your central code source platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each project.

## Five tips for success

Your success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:

1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.
2.  Ask questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you're not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.
3.  Do the readings.
4.  Do the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It's not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)
5.  Don't procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won't know where to begin asking questions. Don't let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.

### Policy on sharing and reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.

### Late work policy

The due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.

-   Homework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.

-   There is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.

-   The late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.

-   The late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.

### Waiver for extenuating circumstances

If there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email [Dr. Lou Odette](mailto:lodette@uwindsor.ca) **and** our head TA `TODO` before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.

### Attendance policy

Responsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.

However, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you're going to miss a lab session and you're feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others' time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.

### Attendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection

Student health, safety, and well-being are the university's top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.

### Inclement weather policy

In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.

*Note:* If you've read this far in the syllabus, email me a picture of your pet if you have one or your favourite meme!
