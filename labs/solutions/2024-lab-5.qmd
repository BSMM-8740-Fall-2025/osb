## Introduction

In today's lab, you'll practice building `workflowsets` with `recipes`, `parsnip` models, `rsample` cross validations, model tuning and model comparison in the context of classification and clustering.

### Learning goals

By the end of the lab you will...

-   Be able to build workflows to fit different classification models.
-   Be able to build workflows to evaluate different clustering models.

## The Data

Today we will be using customer churn data.

In the customer management lifecycle, customer churn refers to a decision made by the customer about ending the business relationship. It is also referred as loss of clients or customers. This dataset contains 20 features related to churn in a telecom context and we will look at how to predict churn and estimate the effect of predictors on the customer churn odds ratio.

```{r}
#| eval: false
data <- 
  readr::read_csv("data/Telco-Customer-Churn.csv", show_col_types = FALSE) |> 
  dplyr::mutate(churn = as.factor(churn))
```

## Exercise 1: EDA

Write and execute the code to perform summary EDA on the data using the package `skimr`. Plot histograms for monthly charges and tenure. Tenure measures the strength of the customer relationship by measuring the length of time that a person has been a customer.

## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}

```
:::

## Exercise 2: train / test splits & recipe

Write and execute code to create training and test datasets. Have the training dataset represent 70% of the total data.

Next create a recipe where churn is related to all the other variables, and

-   normalize the numeric variables
-   create dummy variables for the ordinal predictors

Make sure the steps are in a sequence that preserves the (0,1) dummy variables.

Prep the data on the training data and show the result.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false
set.seed(8740)

# split data


# create a recipe

```
:::

## Exercise 3: logistic modeling

1.  Create a linear model using logistic regression to predict churn. for the *set engine* stage use "glm," and set the mode to "classification."
2.  Create a workflow using the recipe of the last exercise and the model if the last step.
3.  With the workflow, fit the training data
4.  Combine the training data and the predictions from step 3 using `broom::augment` , and assign the result to a variable
5.  Create a combined metric function using `yardstick::metric_set` as show in the code below:
6.  Use the variable from step 4 as the first argument to the function from step 5. The other arguments are `truth = churn` (from the data) and `estimate=.pred_class` (from step 4). Make a note of the numerical metrics.
7.  Use the variable from step 4 as the first argument to the functions listed below, with arguments `truth = churn` and ``` estimate =``.pred_No ```.
    -   `yardstick::roc_auc`
    -   `yardstick::roc_curve` followed by `ggplot2::autoplot()`.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# create a linear regression model

# create a workflow

# fit the workflow

# augment the training data with the fitted data
```

```{r}
# create the metrics function

    , yardstick::sens
    , yardstick::ppv
    , yardstick::npv
)
```

```{r}
# compute roc_auc and plot the roc_curve
```

## Exercise 4: effects

Use broom::tidy() on the fit object from exercise 4 to get the predictor coefficients. Sort them in decreasing order by absolute value.

What is the effect of one additional year of [**tenure**]{.underline} on the churn odds ratio?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false

# 

```

The effect of one additional year of tenure on the churn odds ratio is \_\_.
:::

## Exercise 5 knn modeling

Now we will create a K-nearest neighbours model to estimate churn. To do this, write the code for the following steps:

1.  Create a K-nearest neighbours model to predict churn using `parsnip::nearest_neighbor` with argument `neighbors = 3` which will use the three most similar data points from the training set to predict churn. For the *set engine* stage use "kknn," and set the mode to "classification."
2.  Take the workflow from exercise 3 and create a new workflow by updating the original workflow. Use `workflows::update_model` to swap out the original logistic model for the nearest neighbour model.
3.  Use the new workflow to fit the **training data**. Take the fit and use `broom::augment` to augment the fit with the **training data**.
4.  Use the augmented data from step 3 to plot the roc curve, using `yardstick::roc_curve(.pred_No, truth = churn)` as in exercise 3. How do you interpret his curve?
5.  Take the fit from step 3 and use `broom::augment` to augment the fit with the **test data**.
6.  Repeat step 4 using the augmented data from step 5.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
?parsnip::nearest_neighbor

# create a knn classification model model

# create a workflow

# fit the workflow

# augment the training data with the fitted data
```

```{r}
# compute the metrics
```

```{r}
?yardstick::roc_curve
# compute roc_auc and plot the roc_curve
```
:::

## Exercise 6 cross validation

Following the last exercise, we should have some concerns about over-fitting by the nearest-neighbour model.

To address this we will use cross validation to tune the model and evaluate the fits.

1.  Create a cross-validation dataset based on **5 folds** using `rsample::vfold_cv`.
2.  Using the **knn** workflow from exercise 5, apply `tune::fit_resamples` with arguments `resamples` and `control` where the resamples are the dataset created in step 1 and control is `tune::control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE)`, which will ensure that the predictions are saved.
3.  Use `tune::collect_metrics()` on the results from step 2
4.  Use tune::collect_predictions() on the results from step 2 to plot the roc_auc curve as in exercise 5. Has it changed much from exercise 5?

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
?rsample::vfold_cv

# create v-fold cross validation data

# use tune::fit on the cv dat, saving the predictions
```

```{r}
?tune::fit_resamples

# collect the metrics

# compute the roc_curve
```

## Exercise 7: tuning for k

In this exercise we'll tune the number of nearest neighbours in our model to see if we can improve performance.

1.  Redo exercise 5 steps 1 and 2, setting `neighbors = tune::tune()` for the model, and then updating the workflow with `workflows::update_model`.
2.  Use `dials::grid_regular(dials::neighbors(), levels = 10)` to create a grid for tuning **k**.
3.  Use `tune::tune_grid` with `tune::control_grid(save_pred = TRUE)` and `yardstick::metric_set(yardstick::accuracy, yardstick::roc_auc)` to generate tuning results

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
?tune::tune_grid

# re-specify the model for tuning


# update the workflow


# make a grid for tuning


# use the grid to tune the model


# show the tuning results dataframe
```
:::

## Exercise 8

Use `tune::collect_metrics()` to collect the metrics from the tuning results in exercise 7 and then plot the metrics as a function of **k** using the code below.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# collect the metrics

# plot the collected metrics as a function of K
_your_metrics_ |>
ggplot(aes(neighbors,mean)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5, alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~ .metric, scales = "free", nrow = 2)
```
:::

## Exercise 9

Use `tune::show_best` and `tune::select_best` with argument **"roc_auc"** to find the best **k** for the knn classification model. Then

1.  update the workflow using `tune::finalize_workflow` to set the best k value.
2.  use `tune::last_fit` with the updated workflow from step 1, evaluated on the split data from exercise 2 to finalize the fit.
3.  use `tune::collect_metrics()` to get the metrics for the best fit
4.  use `tune::collect_predictions()` to get the predictions and plot the **roc_auc** as in the prior exercises

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
?tune::finalize_workflow
# show the roc_auc metrics

# select the best roc_auc metric (using a function from tune::)

# finalize the workflow with the best nn metric from the last step

# use  tune::last_fit with the finaized workflow on the data_split (ex 2)

# collect the metrics from the final fit

# collect the predictions from the final fit and plot the roc_curve
```

## Exercise 10: clustering

Load the data for this exercise as below and plot it, and then create an analysis dataset with the cluster labels removed

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple" icon="false"}
## YOUR ANSWER:

```{r}
#| eval: false
# read the data
labelled_points <- readr::read_csv("data/lab_5_clusters.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)

# plot the clusters
labelled_points |> ggplot(aes(x1, x2, color = cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) + 
  theme(legend.position="none")

# remove cluster labels to make the analysis dataset
points <-
  labelled_points |>
  select(?)
```

You have frequently used `broom::augment` to combine a model with the data set, and `broom::tidy` to summarize model components; `broom::glance` is used to similarly to summarize goodness-of-fit metrics.

Now perform k-means clustering on the points data for different values of k as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
kclusts <-
  # number of clusters from 1-9
  tibble(k = 1:9) |>
  # mutate to add columns
  mutate(
    # a list-column with the results of the kmeans function (clustering)
    kclust = purrr::map(k, ~stats::kmeans(points, .x)),
    # a list-column with the results broom::tidy applied to the clustering results
    tidied = purrr::map(kclust, broom::tidy),
    # a list-column with the results broom::glance applied to the clustering results
    glanced = purrr::map(kclust, broom::glance),
    # a list-column with the results broom::augment applied to the clustering results
    augmented = purrr::map(kclust, broom::augment, points)
  )
```

**(i)** Create 3 variables by `tidyr::unnest`ing the appropriate columns of **kclusts**

```{r}
#| eval: false
# take kclusts and use tidy::unnest() on the appropriate columns

clusters <- ?

assignments <- ?

clusterings <- ?

```

**(ii)** Use the **assignments** variable to plot the cluster assignments generated by `stats::kmeans`

```{r}
#| eval: false
# plot the points assigned to each cluster
p <- assignments |> ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = x2)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = .cluster), alpha = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ k) + theme(legend.position="none")
p
```

**(iii)** Use the **clusters** variable to add the cluster centers to the plot

```{r}
#| eval: false
# on the last plot, mark the cluster centres with an X
p + geom_point(data = clusters, size = 10, shape = "x")
```

**(iv)** Use the **clusterings** variable to plot the total within sum of squares value by number of clusters.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# make a separate line-and-point plot with the tot-withinss data by cluster number
clusterings |> ggplot(aes(k, tot.withinss)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

**(v)** Using the results of parts (iii) and (iv), the **k** (number of clusters) that **gives the best results is \_\_.**
