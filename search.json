Check back later to see if it’s been resolved. If there’s a deadline coming up soon, post on the course forum to let us know that there’s an issue. We can look into how quickly it might get resolved and decide on what to do about the deadline accordingly. Note: We don’t anticipate this to happen regularly, the systems are Operational a huge majority of the time!\nIf the status shows Operational, this means the system is expected to be working. Check your internet connection, if need be, restart your computer to ensure a fresh new connection. If your issue persists, post on the course forum with details on what you’ve tried and the errors you see (including verbatim errors and/or screenshots).\nEither way you can also fill out the form here, which will notify our the R TA for the department as well as our undergraduate coordinator.

The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

    "text": "Maximum Likelihood Estimation of 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} and σ\\sigma\nTo understand the formulas for AIC and BIC, we will first briefly explain the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimates for regression.\nLet 𝐘\\mathbf{Y} be n×1n \\times 1 matrix of responses, 𝐗\\mathbf{X}, the n×(p+1)n \\times (p+1) matrix of predictors, and 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, (p+1)×1(p+1) \\times 1 matrix of coefficients. If the multiple linear regression model is correct then,\n𝐘∼N(𝐗𝛃,σ2)(1)\n\\mathbf{Y} \\sim N(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2)\n \\qquad(1)\nWhen we do linear regression, our goal is to estimate the unknown parameters 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} and σ2\\sigma^2 from Equation 1. In Matrix Notation for Multiple Linear Regression, we showed a way to estimate these parameters using matrix alegbra. Another approach for estimating 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} and σ2\\sigma^2 is using maximum likelihood estimation.\nA likelihood function is used to summarise the evidence from the data in support of each possible value of a model parameter. Using Equation 1, we will write the likelihood function for linear regression as\nL(𝐗,𝐘|𝛃,σ2)=∏i=1n(2πσ2)−12exp{−12σ2∑i=1n(Yi−𝐗i𝛃)T(Yi−𝐗i𝛃)}(2)\nL(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) = \\prod\\limits_{i=1}^n (2\\pi \\sigma^2)^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\exp\\bigg\\{-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg\\}\n \\qquad(2)\nwhere YiY_i is the ithi^{th} response and 𝐗i\\mathbf{X}_i is the vector of predictors for the ithi^{th} observation. One approach estimating 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} and σ2\\sigma^2 is to find the values of those parameters that maximize the likelihood in Equation 2, i.e. maximum likelhood estimation. To make the calculations more manageable, instead of maximizing the likelihood function, we will instead maximize its logarithm, i.e. the log-likelihood function. The values of the parameters that maximize the log-likelihood function are those that maximize the likelihood function. The log-likelihood function we will maximize is\nlogL(𝐗,𝐘|𝛃,σ2)=∑i=1n−12log(2πσ2)−12σ2∑i=1n(Yi−𝐗i𝛃)T(Yi−𝐗i𝛃)=−n2log(2πσ2)−12σ2(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)T(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)(3)\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log L(\\mathbf{X}, \\mathbf{Y}|\\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\sigma^2) &= \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n -\\frac{1}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(Y_i - \\mathbf{X}_i \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) \\\\\n&= -\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n \\qquad(3)\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate of 𝛃\\boldsymbol{\\beta} and σ2\\sigma^2 are 𝛃̂=(𝐗T𝐗)−1𝐗T𝐘σ̂2=1n(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)T(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)=1nRSS(4)\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y} \\hspace{1cm} \\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}) = \\frac{1}{n}RSS\n \\qquad(4)\nwhere RSSRSS is the residual sum of squares. Note that the maximum likelihood estimate is not exactly equal to the estimate of σ2\\sigma^2 we typically use RSSn−p−1\\frac{RSS}{n-p-1}. This is because the maximum likelihood estimate of σ2\\sigma^2 in Equation 4 is a biased estimator of σ2\\sigma^2. When nn is much larger than the number of predictors pp, then the differences in these two estimates are trivial.",

Here is the original paper on AIC concept by Akaike – A New Look at the Statistical Modeling Identification. The purpose of AIC is to find a model that maximizes the likelihood of the data while taking into account the number of parameters used. The formula for AIC is as follows:\nAIC=−2logL+2(p+1)(5)\nAIC = -2 \\log L + 2(p+1)\n \\qquad(5)\nwhere logL\\log L is the log-likelihood which measures how well the model fits the data. The term p+1p+1 represents the number of parameters in the model, including the intercept and any additional predictors. This is the general form of AIC that can be applied to a variety of models, but for now, let’s focus on AIC for mutliple linear regression.\nAIC=−2logL+2(p+1)=−2[−n2log(2πσ2)−12σ2(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)T(𝐘−𝐗𝛃)]+2(p+1)=nlog(2πRSSn)+1RSS/nRSS=nlog(2π)+nlog(RSS)−nlog(n)+2(p+1)(6)\n\\begin{aligned}\nAIC &= -2 \\log L + 2(p+1) \\\\\n&= -2\\bigg[-\\frac{n}{2}\\log(2\\pi\\sigma^2) - \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T(\\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{X} \\boldsymbol{\\beta})\\bigg] + 2(p+1) \\\\\n&= n\\log\\big(2\\pi\\frac{RSS}{n}\\big) + \\frac{1}{RSS/n}RSS \\\\\n&= n\\log(2\\pi) + n\\log(RSS) - n\\log(n) + 2(p+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n \\qquad(6)",

    "text": "BIC\nSimilar to AIC, the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) is another model selection criterion that considers both model fit and complexity. BIC is based on Bayesian principles and provides a more stronger penalty for model complexity compared to AIC. Gideon Schwarz’s foundational paper on BIC is titled “Estimating the Dimension of a Model” and was published in 1978. The formula for BIC is as follows:\nBIC=−2logL+(p+1)logn(7)\nBIC = -2 \\log L + (p+1) \\log n\n \\qquad(7)\nIn the formula, the terms logL\\log L and p+1p+1 have the same meaning as in AIC. Additionally, the term logn\\log n represents the logarithm of the sample size (nn). The logn\\log n term in BIC introduces a stronger penalty for model complexity compared to AIC, as the penalty term scales with the sample size.\nThe main difference between AIC and BIC lies in the penalty term for model complexity. While AIC penalizes complexity to some extent with the term 2(p+1)2 (p+1), BIC’s penalty increases logarithmically with the sample size, resulting in a more pronounced penalty. Therefore, BIC tends to favor simpler models compared to AIC, promoting a more parsimonious approach to model selection.",

    "text": "Hat Matrix & Leverage\nRecall from the notes Matrix Form of Linear Regression that 𝛃̂\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} can be written as the following:\n𝛃̂=(𝐗T𝐗)−1𝐗T𝐘(5)\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\n \\qquad(5)\nCombining Equation 4 and Equation 5, we can write 𝐘̂\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} as the following:\n𝐘̂=𝐗𝛃̂=𝐗(𝐗T𝐗)−1𝐗T𝐘(6)\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} &= \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{Y}\\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n \\qquad(6)\nWe define the hat matrix as an n×nn \\times n matrix of the form 𝐇=𝐗(𝐗T𝐗)−1𝐗T\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T. Thus Equation 6 becomes\n𝐘̂=𝐇𝐘(7)\n\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y}\n \\qquad(7)\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix are a measure of how far the predictor variables of each observation are from the means of the predictor variables. For example, hiih_{ii} is a measure of how far the values of the predictor variables for the ithi^{th} observation, xi1,xi2,…,xipx_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{ip}, are from the mean values of the predictor variables, x‾1,x‾2,…,x‾p\\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_2, \\ldots, \\bar{x}_p. In the case of simple linear regression, the ithi^{th} diagonal, hiih_{ii}, can be written as\nhii=1n+(xi−x‾)2∑j=1n(xj−x‾)2\nh_{ii} =  \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_j-\\bar{x})^2}\n\nWe call these diagonal elements, the leverage of each observation.\nThe diagonal elements of the hat matrix have the following properties:\n\n0≤hii≤10 \\leq h_ii \\leq 1\n∑i=1nhii=p+1\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} = p+1, where pp is the number of predictor variables in the model.\nThe mean hat value is h‾=∑i=1nhiin=p+1n\\bar{h} = \\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii}}{n} = \\frac{p+1}{n}.\n\nUsing these properties, we consider a point to have high leverage if it has a leverage value that is more than 2 times the average. In other words, observations with leverage greater than 2(p+1)n\\frac{2(p+1)}{n} are considered to be high leverage points, i.e. outliers in the predictor variables. We are interested in flagging high leverage points, because they may have an influence on the regression coefficients.\nWhen there are high leverage points in the data, the regression line will tend towards those points; therefore, one property of high leverage points is that they tend to have small residuals. We will show this by rewriting the residuals from Equation 4 using Equation 7.\n𝐞=𝐘−𝐘̂=𝐘−𝐇𝐘=(1−𝐇)𝐘(8)\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e} &= \\mathbf{Y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{Y} \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{Y}\n\\end{aligned}\n \\qquad(8)\nNote that the identity matrix and hat matrix are idempotent, i.e. 𝐈𝐈=𝐈\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{I}, 𝐇𝐇=𝐇\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{H}. Thus, (𝐈−𝐇)(\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{H}) is also idempotent. These matrices are also symmetric. Using these properties and Equation 8, we have that the variance-covariance matrix of the residuals 𝐞\\boldsymbol{e}, is\nVar(𝐞)=𝐞𝐞T=(1−𝐇)Var(𝐘)T(1−𝐇)T=(1−𝐇)σ̂2(1−𝐇)T=σ̂2(1−𝐇)(1−𝐇)=σ̂2(1−𝐇)(9)\n\\begin{aligned}\nVar(\\mathbf{e}) &= \\mathbf{e}\\mathbf{e}^T \\\\[10pt]\n&=  (1-\\mathbf{H})Var(\\mathbf{Y})^T(1-\\mathbf{H})^T \\\\[10pt]\n&= (1-\\mathbf{H})\\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})^T  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})(1-\\mathbf{H})  \\\\[10pt]\n&= \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-\\mathbf{H})\n\\end{aligned}\n \\qquad(9)\nwhere σ̂2=∑i=1nei2n−p−1\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}e_i^2}{n-p-1} is the estimated regression variance. Thus, the variance of the ithi^{th} residual is Var(ei)=σ̂2(1−hii)Var(e_i) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2(1-h_{ii}). Therefore, the higher the leverage, the smaller the variance of the residual. Because the expected value of the residuals is 0, we conclude that points with high leverage tend to have smaller residuals than points with lower leverage.",

One possibility is to run the full regression of yy on xx, as usual.\nHowever, we can also regress x1x_1 on x2x_2, take the residuals, and regress yy only those residuals. The first part of this process is sometimes referred to as partialling-out (or orthogonalization, or residualization) of x1x_1 with respect to x2x_2. The idea is that we are isolating the variation in x1x_1 that is independent of (orthogonal to) x2x_2. Note that x2x_2 can be also be multi-dimensional (i.e. include multiple variables and not just one).\nWhy would one ever do that?\nThis seems like a way more complicated procedure. Instead of simply doing the regression in 1 step, now we need to do 2 or even 3 steps. It’s not intuitive at all. The main advantage comes from the fact that we have reduced a multivariate regression to a univariate one, making more tractable and more intuitive.\n\n\nExample1\nUsing the data from OVB example:\n\n&gt; # partial out unobserved1 (predictor) from price1 (predictor)\n&gt; fit_price &lt;- lm(price1 ~ unobserved1, data = dat1)\n&gt; \n&gt; # regress demand1 (outcome) on price residuals\n&gt; lm(\n+   demand1 ~ price_resid\n+   , data = tibble::tibble(demand1 = dat1$demand1, price_resid = fit_price$residuals)\n+ ) %&gt;% \n+   broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic     p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   17.9      0.0830    216.   0          \n2 price_resid   -0.443    0.0828     -5.35 0.000000135\n\n\n\n&gt; # partial out unobserved1 (predictor) from demand1 (outcome)\n&gt; fit_demand &lt;- lm(demand1 ~ unobserved1, data = dat1)\n&gt; \n&gt; # regress demand residuals on price residuals\n&gt; lm(\n+   demand_resid ~ price_resid\n+   , data = tibble::tibble(demand_resid = fit_demand$residuals, price_resid = fit_price$residuals)\n+ ) %&gt;% \n+   broom::tidy()\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  1.37e-16    0.0445  3.08e-15 1.00e+ 0\n2 price_resid -4.43e- 1    0.0444 -9.99e+ 0 1.59e-21",

Cov(x̃,y)Var(x̃)\\frac{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\tilde{x},y\\right)}{\\text{Var}\\left(\\tilde{x}\\right)} has the same sign as β1\\beta_1 and our data gives us a lower bound for

\\qquad(2)\nWith respect to how tight the bounds are, let rr denote the correlation between x̃\\tilde{x} and yy, then\nr2=Cov(x̃,y)2Var(x̃)Var(y)=Cov(x̃,y)Var(x̃)×Cov(x̃,y)Var(y)r2×Var(y)Cov(x̃,y)=Cov(x̃,y)Var(x̃)\n\\begin{align*}\nr^{2} &

& =\\frac{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\tilde{x},y\\right)}{\\text{Var}\\left(\\tilde{x}\\right)}\n\\end{align*}\n\nand the the width of the bounds in Equation 2 is\nwidth=|Var(y)Cov(x̃,y)−Cov(x̃,y)Var(x̃)|=(1−r2)|Var(y)Cov(x̃,y)|\n\\text{width}=\\left|\\frac{\\text{Var}\\left(y\\right)}{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\tilde{x},y\\right)}-\\frac{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\tilde{x},y\\right)}{\\text{Var}\\left(\\tilde{x}\\right)}\\right|=\\left(1-r^{2}\\right)\\left|\\frac{\\text{Var}\\left(y\\right)}{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\tilde{x},y\\right)}\\right|\n\nSo the bounds for β1\\beta_1 are tighter when x̃\\tilde{x} and yy are strongly correlated.\nsee ovb",

The magic of doubly robust estimation happens because in causal inference, there are two ways to remove bias from our causal estimates: you either model the treatment mechanism or the outcome mechanism. If either of these models are correct, you are good to go.\nOne caveat is that, in practice, it’s very hard to model precisely either of those. More often, what ends up happening is that neither the propensity score nor the outcome model are 100% correct. They are both wrong, but in different ways. When this happens, it is not exactly settled [1] [2] [3] if it’s better to use a single model or doubly robust estimation. I still like using them because at least it gives me two possibilities of being correct."

    "text": "Matching bias again\n\nWe saw that matching is biased when the unit and its match are not so similar. But what causes them to be so different?\nAs it turns out, the answer is quite simple and intuitive. It is easy to find people that match on a few characteristics, like sex. But if we add more characteristics, like age, income, city of birth and so on, it becomes harder and harder to find matches. In more general terms, the more features we have, the higher will be the distance between units and their matches.\nThis is not something that hurts only the matching estimator. It ties back to the subclassification estimator we saw earlier. In that contrived medicine example where with man and woman, it was quite easy to build the subclassification estimator. That was because we only had 2 cells: man and woman. But what would happen if we had more?\nLet’s say we have 2 continuous features like age and income and we manage to discretise them into 5 buckets each. This will give us 25 cells, or \\(5^2\\). And what if we had 10 covariates with 3 buckets each? Doesn’t seem like a lot right? Well, this would give us 59049 cells, or \\(3^{10}\\). It’s easy to see how this can blow out of proportion pretty quickly. This is a phenomena pervasive in all data science, which is called the The Curse of Dimensionality!!!"

This is incredibly common in the industry, where companies track user data over multiple weeks and months.\nTo understand how we can leverage such data structure, let’s first continue with our diff-in-diff example, where we wanted to estimate the impact of placing a billboard (treatment) in the city of Porto Alegre (POA). We want to see if that sort of offline marketing strategy can boost the usage of our investment products. Specifically, we want to know how much deposits in our investments account would increase if we placed billboards."

For instance, take a classical labor economics problem of figuring out the impact of marriage on men’s earnings. It’s a well known fact in economics that married men earn more than single men. However, it is not clear if this relationship is causal or not.\nIt could be that more educated men are both more likely to marry and more likely to have a high earnings job, which would mean that education is a confounder of the effect of marriage on earnings. For this confounder, we could measure the education of the person in the study and run a regression controlling for that.\nBut another confounder could be beauty. It could be that more handsome men are both more likely to get married and more likely to have a high paying job. Unfortunately, beauty is one of those characteristics like intelligence.

We say “memoryless”, because we only need to remember what square we’ve reached, not which squares we used to get here. The stochastic process before this moment has no bearing on the future, given where we are now. A mathematical way to say this is that “the past and the future are conditionally independent given the present.”"

IVs are an unusual circumstance where, under certain conditions, controlling for them can make other types of bias worse.\nWhat’s unique about this is that IVs can also be used to conduct an entirely different approach to estimating an unbiased effect of the exposure on the outcome. IVs are commonly used this way in econometrics and are increasingly popular in other areas.\nIn short, IV analysis allows us to estimate the causal effect using a different set of assumptions than the approaches we’ve talked about thus far.\nIf you’re unsure if the variable is an IV or not, you should probably add it to your model: it’s more likely to be a confounder than an IV, and, it turns out, the bias from adding an IV is usually small in practice. So, like adjusting for a potential M-structure variable, the risk of bias is worse from confounding."

Share it early and often with others who are experts on the data, domain, and models.\nIf you have more than one candidate DAG, check their adjustment sets.

These are averaged.\nMacro-weighted averaging does the same but the average is weighted by the number of samples in each class.\nMicro-averaging computes the contribution for each class, aggregates them, then computes a single metric from the aggregates."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

Two friends, Elliott and Adrian, want to build a model predicting typing speed (average number of words typed per minute) from whether the person wears glasses or not. Before building the model they want to conduct some exploratory analysis to evaluate the strength of the association between these two variables, but they’re in disagreement about how to evaluate how strongly a categorical predictor is associated with a numerical outcome. Elliott claims that it is not possible to calculate a correlation coefficient to summarize the relationship between a categorical predictor and a numerical outcome, however they’re not sure what a better alternative is. Adrian claims that you can recode a binary predictor as a 0/1 variable (assign one level to be 0 and the other to be 1), thus converting it to a numerical variable. According to Adrian, you can then calculate the correlation coefficient between the predictor and the outcome. Who is right: Elliott or Adrian? If you pick Elliott, can you suggest a better alternative for evaluating the association between the categorical predictor and the numerical outcome?\nHigh correlation, good or bad? Two friends, Frances and Annika, are in disagreement about whether high correlation values are always good in the context of regression. Frances claims that it’s desirable for all variables in the dataset to be highly correlated to each other when building linear models. Annika claims that while it’s desirable for each of the predictors to be highly correlated with the outcome, it is not desirable for the predictors to be highly correlated with each other. Who is right: Frances, Annika, both, or neither? Explain your reasoning using appropriate terminology.\nTraining for the 5K. Nico signs up for a 5K (a 5,000 metre running race) 30 days prior to the race. They decide to run a 5K every day to train for it, and each day they record the following information: days_since_start (number of days since starting training), days_till_race (number of days left until the race), mood (poor, good, awesome), tiredness (1-not tired to 10-very tired), and time (time it takes to run 5K, recorded as mm:ss).

For each statement that is false, explain why it is false.\n\nIf predictors are colinear, then removing one variable will have no influence on the point estimate of another variable’s coefficient.\nSuppose a numerical predictor xx has a coefficient of β̂1=2.5\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 2.5 in a multiple regression model. Suppose also that the first observation has x1,1=7.2x_{1,1} = 7.2, the second observation has a value of x2,1=8.2x_{2,1} = 8.2, and these two observations have the same values for all other predictors. Then the predicted value of the second observation will be 2.5 higher than the prediction of the first observation based on the multiple regression model.\nIf a regression model’s first predictor has a coefficient of β̂1=5.7\\hat{\\beta}_1 = 5.7 and if we are able to influence the data so that an observation will have its x1x_1 be 1 larger than it would otherwise, the value ŷ1\\hat{y}_1 for this observation would increase by 5.7."

    "text": "Part 2 - Palmer penguins\nData were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. (Gorman, Williams, and Fraser 2014)\n\n\n\nArtwork by @allison_horst\n\n\nThese data can be found in the palmerpenguins package. We’re going to be working with the penguins dataset from this package. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in this dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\nBody mass. Our first goal is to fit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from bill length, bill depth, flipper length, species, and sex.\n\nFit a model predicting body mass (which is more difficult to measure) from the other variables listed above.\nWrite the equation of the regression model.\nInterpret each one of the slopes in this context.\nCalculate the residual for a male Adelie penguin that weighs 3750 grams with the following body measurements: bill_length_mm = 39.1, bill_depth_mm = 18.7, flipper_length_mm = 181. Does the model overpredict or underpredict this penguin’s weight?\nFind the R2R^2 of this model and interpret this value in context of the data and the model.\n\n\n\n\nBill depth. Next we’ll be focusing on bill depth and bill length and also considering species.\n\nFit a model predicting bill depth from bill length. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nThen, add a new predictor: species. Fit another model predicting bill depth from bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nFinally, add one more predictor: the interaction between bill length and species. Find the adjusted R-squared, AIC, and BIC for this model.\nUsing the three criteria you recorded for these three models, and with the goal of parsimony, which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species. Explain your reasoning.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part a. Hint: Make a scatterplot of bill depth vs. bill length and add the linear model.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part b. Hint: Same as part (e), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nCreate a visualization representing your model from part c. Hint: Same as part (f), but think about how many lines to plot and whether their slopes should be the same or different.\nBased on your visualizations from parts e - g, and with the goal of parsimony, is your answer for which model is the “best” for predicting bill depth from bill length and/or species the same as your answer in part d? Explain your reasoning."

For this study titled Influence of perceived threat of Covid-19 and HEXACO personality traits on toilet paper stockpiling, researchers conducted an online survey March 23 - 29, 2020 and used the results to fit multiple linear regression models to draw conclusions about their research questions. From their survey, they collected data on adults across 35 countries. Given the small number of responses from people outside of the United States, Canada, and Europe, only responses from people in these three locations were included in the regression analysis.\nLet’s consider their results for the model looking at the effect on perceived threat of Covid-19. The model can be found on page 6 of the paper. The perceived threat of Covid was quantified using the responses to the following survey question:\n\nHow threatened do you feel by Coronavirus? [Users select on a 10-point visual analogue scale (Not at all threatened to Extremely Threatened)]\n\n\nInterpret the coefficient of Age (0.072) in the context of the analysis.\nInterpret the coefficient of Place of residence in the context of the analysis.\nThe model includes an interaction between Place of residence and Emotionality (capturing differential tendencies in to worry and be anxious).\n\nWhat does the coefficient for the interaction (0.101) mean in the context of the data?\nInterpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in the US/Canada.\nInterpret the estimated effect of Emotionality for a person who lives in Europe."

In this experiment, participants were asked to watch a video of a mock crime (from the first person perspective), spend a few minutes completing a random task, and then identify the perpetrator of the mock crime from a line up shown on the screen. Every lineup in this analysis included the true perpetrator from the video. After viewing the line-up , each participant could make one of the following decisions (id):\n\ncorrect: correctly identified the true perpetrator\nfoil: incorrectly identified the “foil”, i.e. a person who looks very similar to the perpetrator\nreject: incorrectly concluded the true perpetrator is not in the lineup\n\nThe main objective of the analysis is to understand how different conditions of the mock crime and suspect lineup affect the decision made by the participant. We will consider the following conditions to describe the decisions:\n\nlineup: How potential suspects are shown to the participants\n\nSimultaneous Lineup: Participants were shown photos of all 6 potential suspects at the same time and were required to make a single decision (identify someone from the lineup or reject the lineup).\nSequential 5 Lineup: Photos of the 6 suspects were shown one at a time. The participant was required to make a decision (choose or don’t choose) as each photo was shown. Once a decision was made, participants were not allowed to reexamine a photo. If the participant made an identification, the remaining photos were not shown. In each of these lineups the true perpetrator was always the 5th photo in the lineup.\n\nweapon: Whether or not a weapon was present in the video of the mock crime.\nfeature: Whether or not the perpetrator had a distinctive marking on his face. In this experiment, the distinctive feature was a large “N” sticker on one cheek. (The letter “N” was chosen to represent the first author’s alma mater - University of Nebraska.)\n\nThe data may be found in eyewitness.csv in the data folder.\n\new &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"hw\", \"data/eyewitness.csv\"))\new &lt;- ew %&gt;%\n  mutate(id = as_factor(id))"

It’s not required, but it is good practice and highly encouraged to label your code chunks in this way. If there is an error when you render your document, the code-chunk label will identify where the error is.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\nBen Baumer worked for the New York Mets from 2004 to 2012. What was the team W/L record during those years? Use filter() and select() to quickly identify only those pieces of information that we care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n# fill in the blanks and ensure your code produces the correct result\nmets &lt;- Teams  %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(teamID == \"NYN\")\nmy_mets &lt;- mets %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(_)\nmy_mets %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(_,_,_,_)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nWe’ve answered the simple question of how the Mets performed during the time that Ben was there, but since we are data scientists, we are interested in deeper questions. For example, some of these seasons were subpar—the Mets had more losses than wins. Did the team just get unlucky in those seasons? Or did they actually play as badly as their record indicates?\nIn order to answer this question, we need a model for expected winning percentage. It turns out that one of the most widely used contributions to the field of baseball analytics (courtesy of Bill James) is exactly that. This model translates the number of runs4 that a team scores and allows over the course of an entire season into an expectation for how many games they should have won. The simplest version of this model is this:\nŴpct=11+(RARS)2\n\\hat{\\text{W}}_{\\text{pct}}=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\text{RA}}{\\text{RS}}\\right)^{2}}\n\nwhere RA\\text{RA} is the number of runs the team allows to be scored, RS\\text{RS} is the number of runs that the team scores, and Ŵpct\\hat{\\text{W}}_{\\text{pct}} is the team’s expected winning percentage. Luckily for us, the runs scored and allowed are present in the Teams table, so let’s grab them and save them in a new data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n# fill in the blanks and ensure your code produces the correct result\nmets_ben &lt;- Teams |&gt;\n  dplyr::select(_, _, _, _, _, _) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(_ == \"NYN\" & _ %in% 2004:2012)\nmets_ben\n\nFirst, note that the runs-scored variable is called R in the Teams table, but to stick with our notation we want to rename it RS.\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(_ = _)    # new name = old name\nmets_ben\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to save, stage, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repository. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 1 - 3”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nNext, we need to compute the team’s actual winning percentage in each of these seasons. Thus, we need to add a new column to our data frame, and we do this with the mutate() command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n# add the calculation using the formula above\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(WPct = _)\nmets_ben\n\nThe expected number of wins is then equal to the product of the expected winning percentage times the number of games.\n\n# fill in the blanks and ensure your code produces the correct result\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(W_hat = _)\nmets_ben\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nIn this case, the Mets’ fortunes were better than expected in three of these seasons, and worse than expected in the other six.\nIn how many seasons were the Mets better than expected? How many were they worse than expected?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n# repeat the better_than/ worse_than calculation for all the years in the dataset: show your work.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to save, stage, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 4 and 5”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nNaturally, the Mets experienced ups and downs during Ben’s time with the team. Which seasons were best? To figure this out, we can simply sort the rows of the data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\ndplyr::arrange(mets_ben, _)\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nIn 2006, the Mets had the best record in baseball during the regular season and nearly made the World Series. How do these seasons rank in terms of the team’s performance relative to our model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\nmets_ben %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(Diff = _) |&gt;\n  dplyr::arrange(_)\n\nSummarize the Mets performance:\n\n# fill in the blanks and ensure your code produces the correct result\nmets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarize(\n    num_years = _, \n    total_W = _, \n    total_L = _, \n    total_WPct = _, \n    sum_resid = _\n  )\n\nIn these nine years, the Mets had a combined record of ? wins and ? losses, for an overall winning percentage of _?.\n\n\n\nThis is a good place to save, stage, commit, and push changes to your remote lab-1 repo. Click the checkbox next to each file in the Git pane to stage the updates you’ve made, write an informative commit message (e.g., “Completed exercises 6 - 8”), and push. After you push the changes, the Git pane in RStudio should be empty.\n\n\n\nExercise 8\nDiscretize the years into three chunks: one for each of the three general managers under whom Ben worked. Jim Duquette was the Mets’ general manager in 2004, Omar Minaya from 2005 to 2010, and Sandy Alderson from 2011 to 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben %&gt;% \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    gm = ifelse(\n      yearID == _, \n      _, \n      ifelse(\n        yearID &gt;= _, \n        _, \n        _)\n    )\n  )\n\nAlternatively, we use the case_when function\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    gm = dplyr::case_when(\n      yearID == _ ~ _, \n      yearID &gt;= _ ~ _, \n      TRUE ~ _\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9\nThe following dataset is the basis of a model that predicts which businesses are likely to have customer churn at the start of 2015, based on the business type and incorporation_date.

To do this use tidyr::separate_wider_delim with delim = \"_\" and the specified names.\nNext, use tidyr::pivot_wider with names_from = paymentMandate, and values_from = quantity to create payments and mandates columns.\nFinally, use dplyr::mutate to change the type of the data and incorporation_date columns to Date.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\nWhat is the mean of the sales_per_visit columns/measurement?

The company is growing fast and the marketing team is looking for ways to increase the sales from existing customers by making them buy more. The main idea is to unlock the potential of the customer base through incentives, in this case a discount. We of course want to measure the effect of the discount on the customer’s behavior. Still, they do not want to waste money giving discounts to users which are not valuable. As always, it is about return on investment (ROI).\nWithout going into specifics about the nature of the discount, it has been designed to provide a positive return on investment if the customer buys more than $1\\$ 1 as a result of the discount. How can we measure the effect of the discount and make sure our experiment has a positive ROI? The marketing team came up with the following strategy:\n\nSelect a sample of existing customers from the same cohort.\nSet a test window of 1 month.\nLook into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customer’s interest in the product.\nFor customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount. There will be a hold out group which will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits. For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers which are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.\nWe also want to use the results of the test to tag loyal customers. These are customers which got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.\n\n\n\nThe Data\nThe team collected data from the experiment above and asked the data science team to analyze it and provide insights. In particular they want to know if they should keep the discount strategy. The data consists of the following fields: - visits: Number of visits to the website during the test window. - discount: Whether the customer received a discount or not. - is_loyal: Whether the customer is loyal or not according to the definition above. - sales: Sales in $\\$ during the test window.\n\nPrepare Notebook\nData scientist A was the one in charge of preparing the environment and collecting the data. As an important best practice, they fixed a global seed which initializes the random number generator in order to make sure every part of the analysis was reproducible. This ensures that the calculations are not affected by pure randomness. In addition all the required packages were listed from the start (reproducible R environment).\n\nset.seed(8740)\n\n\n\nRead Data\nThey pulled the data from a csv file and displayed the first 5 measurements.\n\ndata &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"data/sales_dag.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::slice_head(n=5) |&gt; \n  gt::gt() |&gt; \n  gt::tab_header(title = \"sample marketing data\") |&gt; \n  gtExtras::gt_theme_espn()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsample marketing data\n\n\nvisits\ndiscount\nis_loyal\nsales\nsales_per_visit\n\n\n\n\n12\n0\n0\n13.34830\n1.1123585\n\n\n26\n1\n1\n21.70125\n0.8346635\n\n\n13\n0\n0\n14.70040\n1.1308004\n\n\n24\n0\n0\n20.37734\n0.8490557\n\n\n14\n0\n0\n12.63372\n0.9024089\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThey then checked for missing values and whether the measurements were in the correct format.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\nWhat is the mean of the sales_per_visit columns/measurement? Are there any grouped observations?\n\n# run a data exploration here using the skimr package.\ndata |&gt; skimr::skim()\n\n\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nAs part of the project scope, the data science team in charge of the analysis was asked to provide a summary of the data. The team was also asked to provide a visualization of the data to help the marketing team understand the data better. Data scientist A took over this task.\nThey started by looking at the share of customers which received a discount:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n# calculate the % share of customers receiving a discount vs the % not receiving a discount\n\nSimilarly for the share of customers which are loyal:\n\n# calculate the % share of customers that are 'loyal' vs not 'loyal'\n\nTo understand these features better, they also looked at a cross-tab table:\n\n# build a cross-tab table of 'loyal' customers vs customers getting a discount\n\n\n\nNote that all customers with discount are loyal (as required) and that there are loyal users which did not receive a discount. This is because they had exceptional sales numbers. Verify this:\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(id = dplyr::row_number(), .before = 1) |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(discount == 0) |&gt; \n  dplyr::arrange( desc(sales) ) |&gt; \n  dplyr::slice_head(n=10) |&gt; \n  gt::gt() |&gt; \n  gt::tab_header(title = \"Sales: loyal customers vs others\") |&gt; \n  gtExtras::gt_theme_espn()\n\nThe loyal customers are the top ones in terms of sales. This is good news. It means that the definition of loyal customers is consistent with the data.\nIn order to have orders of magnitude for the sales, the data scientist provided some summary statistics table:\n\ngtExtras::gt_plt_summary(data)\n\nTo have a better glimpse of the data, the data scientist also provided a histogram of the sales:\n\ndata |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=sales)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, colour = 1, fill = \"white\") +\n  geom_density(lwd = 1, colour = 4, fill = 4, alpha = 0.25) +\n  labs(title = \"Sales Distribution\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work! Save, stage, commit, and push all remaining changes. You can use the commit message “Done with Lab 1!” , and make sure you have committed and pushed all changed files to GitHub (your Git pane in RStudio should be empty) and that all documents are updated in your repo on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmission\n\n\n\nI will pull (copy) everyone’s repository submissions at 5:00pm on the Sunday following class, and I will work only with these copies, so anything submitted after 5:00pm will not be graded. (don’t forget to commit and then push your work!)"

People like to know who they’re dealing with. Also it makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.\nShorter is better than longer.\nMake it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence, e.g. JennyFromTheBlock.\n\nYou can change your username later, but better to get this right the first time.\n\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/changing-your-github-username/\nhttps://help.github.com/articles/what-happens-when-i-change-my-username/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will be switching between the console and the terminal, in this lab and others. The Console is where you can execute R code, while the Terminal is where you can execute system functions like git.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Git already installed?\nGo to the Terminal tab in RStudio and enter git --version to see its version:\n\ngit --version\n\nIf this instruction gives an error, it’s possible that git is not installed on your machine. If so, let your instructor know.\n\n\n3. Introduce yourself to Git\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nmake sure that the package usethis has been installed. You can check under the packages tab in the file & plots viewer (e.g., do a search).\n\n\nYou can set your Git user name and email from within R (i.e. go back to the Console tab):\n\nusethis::use_git_config(\n  # user.name does not have to be your GitHub user name\n  user.name = \"Jane Doe\"\n  # user.email MUST be the email associated with your GitHub account.\n  , user.email = \"jane@example.org\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYour commits will be labelled with this user name, so make it informative to potential collaborators and future you.\n\n\n\n\n4. Set up personal access tokens for HTTPS\nThe password that you use to login to GitHub’s website is NOT an acceptable credential when talking to GitHub as a Git server. You can learn more in their blog post Token authentication requirements for Git operations.\nThe recommendation to use a personal access token (PAT) is exactly what we cover here. First you need to create your PAT, and you can do this from R (in the Console):\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThe usethis approach takes you to a pre-filled form with pre-selected some recommended scopes, which you can look over and adjust before clicking “Generate token”.\nIt is a very good idea to describe the token’s purpose in the Note field, because one day you might have multiple PATs. We recommend naming each token after its use case, such as the computer or project you are using it for, e.g. “personal-macbook-air” or “lab1-course-8740”. In the future, you will find yourself staring at this list of tokens, because inevitably you’ll need to re-generate or delete one of them. Make it easy to figure out which token you’ve come here to fiddle with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf this is your first time generating a PAT, just accept the defaults and scroll to the bottom of the page and click the green Generate token button.\n\n\n\n4.1 Click “Generate token”.\nYou won’t be able to see this token again, so don’t close or navigate away from this browser window until you store the PAT. Copy the PAT to the clipboard or a text file in RStudio.\nTreat this PAT like a password! Do not ever hard-wire your PAT into your code! A PAT should always be retrieved implicitly, for example, from the Git credential store, a safe place, where command line Git, RStudio, and R packages can discover it.\n\n\n4.2 Save your PAT\n\nCopy the generated PAT to a secure, long-term system for storing secrets, like 1Password or LastPass.\nemail it to yourself.\ncopy it onto a piece of scrap paper.\n\n\n\n4.3 Store your PAT in the Git credential store\nFinally, we store the PAT in a safe place where command line Git, RStudio, and R packages can discover it. To do this call gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). If you don’t have a PAT stored already, it will prompt you to enter your PAT. Paste!\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nInstead of saving your PAT you could just re-generate the PAT each lab session and re-store it. If you accept the default 30-day expiration period, this is a workflow you’ll be using often anyway.\nOn github.com, assuming you’re signed in, you can manage your personal access tokens from https://github.com/settings/tokens, also reachable via Settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal access tokens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nGiven that the machines start from the same initial state each lab session, you will follow the above steps to initial your machine at the start of each lab session.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. How Git works\nGit has three storages locally: a Working directory, Staging Area, and a Local repository.\n𝟭. 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗗𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 - is where you work, and your files live (“untracked”). GIT is not aware of these files.\n𝟮. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗿𝗲𝗮 - When you stage your changes, GIT will start tracking and saving your changes with files. These changes are stored in the .git directory.\n𝟯. 𝗟𝗼𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝘆 - is the area where everything is saved (commits) in the .git directory. So, when you want to move your files from Staging Area to Local Repository, you can use the git commit command. After this, your Staging area will be empty. If you want to see what is in the Local repository, try git log.\nThe workflow looks like this:\n\n\n\nGit workflow\n\n\nYou are now ready interact with GitHub via RStudio!\n\n\nClone the repo & start new RStudio project\n\nFirst make sure you are logged into your own Github account on a web browser.\nNext, in a new browser tab, go to the course organization site at BSMM-8740-Fall-2023 on GitHub. Click on the repo BSMM-lab-1. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.\nClick on the green Use this template button and select Create a new repository. This will make a copy of BSMM-lab-1 in your own github account.\nNext, go back to your Github acount and select your copy of BSMM-lab-1. Click on the green CODE button, select Use HTTPS (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you’ll see the text Clone with HTTPS). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.\nIn RStudio, go to File ➛ New Project ➛Version Control ➛ Git.\nCopy and paste the URL of your assignment repo (the clipboard copy you made in step 4) into the dialog box Repository URL. The project directory name should be automatically populated, but make sure you select a directory in Create project as a subdirectory of.\nFinally, click Create Project, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed in the Files pane in RStudio.\nClick bsmm-lab-1.qmd to open the template R Markdown file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.\n\n\n\nR and R Studio\nBelow are the components of the RStudio IDE.\n\nBelow are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.\n\n\n\nYAML\nThe top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called YAML. It stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”. It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nOpen the Quarto (`.qmd`) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered HTML document in the Files pane.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting changes\nNow, go to the Git pane in your RStudio instance. This will be in the top right hand corner in a separate tab.\nIf you have made changes to your *.qmd file, you should see it listed here. Click on it to select it in this list and then click on Diff. This shows you the difference between the last committed state of the document and its current state including changes. You should see deletions in red and additions in green.\nIf you’re happy with these changes, we’ll prepare the changes to be pushed to your remote repository. First, stage your changes by checking the appropriate box on the files you want to prepare. Next, write a meaningful commit message (for instance, “updated author name”) in the Commit message box. Finally, click Commit. Note that every commit needs to have a commit message associated with it.\nYou don’t have to commit after every change, as this would get quite tedious. You should commit states that are meaningful to you for inspection, comparison, or restoration.\nIn the first few assignments we will tell you exactly when to commit and in some cases, what commit message to use. As the semester progresses we will let you make these decisions.\n\n\nPush changes\nNow that you have made an update and committed this change, it’s time to push these changes to your repo on GitHub.\nIn order to push your changes to GitHub, you must have staged your commit to be pushed. click on Push.\nNow let’s make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you’re good to go!\nMore on the basic use of git here."

In this case we reduced the 40 original predictors to just 5 predictors.\nThe challenge with using these methods is attaching meaning to the revised predictors, and this is important when we need to explain our models. The computer can compute the new predictors but they can’t tell us what they represent. For this we need to look at the structure of the new predictors and see if we can attach some meaning to them; often the solution is to give them names that capture the underlying structure.\nIn this case, looking at the ingredients that make up the PCA predictors\n\nPC1 represents a drink with:\n\nlittle or no sugar, egg, gin or port; some or a lot of syrup and citrus juice\nmost often / mainly tequila\n\nPC2 represents a drink with:\n\nlittle or no sugar, syrup, or citrus juice\nmost often / mainly vermouth\n\nPC3 represents a drink with:\n\nlittle or no egg, whiskey or vodka\nmost often / mainly gin\n\nPC4 represents a drink with\n\nlittle or no syrup; some or a lot of juice and dairy product\nmost often / mainly grenadine and vodka\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nFor this exercise, bake the prepped PCA recipe using recipes::bake on the original data and plot each cocktail by its PC1, PC2 component, using\n\nggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, label = name)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, hjust = \"inward\") + \n  labs(color = NULL)\n\nCan you create an interpretation of the PCA analysis?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\n# bake the dataset cocktails_df, creating a new dataset\nrecipes::bake(pca_prep, new_data = cocktails_df) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(PC1, PC2, label = name)) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = category), alpha = 0.7, size = 2) +\n  geom_text(check_overlap = TRUE, hjust = \"inward\") + \n  labs(color = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise we are plotting the cocktails against the first two principal components and trying to interpret the results.\nThe interpretation is more difficult now than it was in the last exercise where we found an interpretation for each principal component. Now we are looking at each cocktail in terms of combinations of PC1 and PC2, both positive and negative.\nIt appears that the lower left quadrant (negative PC1 and PC2 values) are mainly cocktail classics. If you look at the components of PC1 and PC2 from the last exercise and negate them, you can describe the cocktails in this quadrant: they have egg /egg-white, port, sugar, no vermouth or gin or tequila.\nThe lower right quadrant is positive PC1 and negative PC2. PC1 contains juice and syrup, while PC2 is negative juice and syrup - so in this quadrant we have cocktails that are like PC1 (juice and syrup) and unlike PC2 (juice and syrup & sugar). The cocktails in this quadrant have citrus juice, are sweet from the use of syrup & sugar and likely have tequila.\nThe top half of the plot shows cocktails clustered along the PC1=0 axis, so those are mainly tequila cocktails, very much like PC2.\nIs there an opportunity to create a new cocktail in the upper left or upper right quadrants?\n\n\n\n\nExercise 8\nIn the following exercise, we’ll use the recipes package to prepare time series data.

The basic model will be:\nSalesVolume ~ .\nwhere the date and region-name are id variables, not predictor variables. Instead we will use the prior-month lagged prices as the only predictor.\nThe recipe uses the following 5 steps from the recipes package: update_role(region_name, new_role = “id”) | recipe(sales_volume ~ ., data = df |&gt; janitor::clean_names()) | step_naomit(lag_1_sales_volume, skip=FALSE) | step_lag(sales_volume, lag=1) | step_arrange(region_name, date)\nUse these 5 steps in the proper order to create a recipe to pre-process the time series data for each region.

The company is growing fast and the marketing team is looking for ways to increase the sales from existing customers by making them buy more. The main idea is to unlock the potential of the customer base through incentives, in this case a discount. We of course want to measure the effect of the discount on the customer’s behavior. Still, they do not want to waste money giving discounts to users which are not valuable. As always, it is about return on investment (ROI).\nWithout going into specifics about the nature of the discount, it has been designed to provide a positive return on investment if the customer buys more than $1\\$ 1 as a result of the discount. How can we measure the effect of the discount and make sure our experiment has a positive ROI? The marketing team came up with the following strategy:\n\nSelect a sample of existing customers from the same cohort.\nSet a test window of 1 month.\nLook into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customer’s interest in the product.\nFor customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount. There will be a hold out group which will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits. For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers which are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.\nWe also want to use the results of the test to tag loyal customers. These are customers which got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.\n\nIn the last lab we did some exploratory data analysis. The next step is to prepare some descriptive statistics.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe first thing the data analytics team did was to split the sales distribution by discount group:\n\ndata &lt;- readr::read_csv('data/sales_dag.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sales, after_stat(count), fill = discount)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.30, position = 'identity', color=\"#e9ecef\", bins = 30)+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.30) +\n  xlab(\"Sales\") +\n  ylab(\"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks customers with a discount have higher sales. Data scientist A is optimistic with this initial result. To quantify this, they computed the difference in means:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\ndifference in means:\n\nmean_sales &lt;- data |&gt; dplyr::group_by(discount) |&gt; \n  dplyr::summarize(\"mean sales\" = mean(sales)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\"mean sales difference\" = `mean sales` - lag(`mean sales`))\nmean_sales\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  discount `mean sales` `mean sales difference`\n     &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;                   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        0         15.8                   NA   \n2        1         20.6                    4.80\n\n\n\n\nOur calculation gives a $4.8\\$ 4.8 mean uplift! This is great news. The discount strategy seems to be working. Data scientist A is happy with the results and decides to get feedback from the rest of the data science team.\nData scientist B is not so happy with the results. They think that the uplift is too good to be true (based on domain knowledge and the sales distributions 🤔). When thinking about reasons for such a high uplift, they realized the discount assignment was not at random. It was based on the number of web visits (remember the marketing plan?). This means that the discount group is not comparable to the control group completely! They decide to plot sales against web visits per discount group:\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=visits, y = sales, color = discount)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  facet_grid(cols = vars(discount))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, they realize they should probably adjust for the number of web visits. A natural metric is sales per web visit. Let’s compute it:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\nmean_sales_pv &lt;- data |&gt; dplyr::group_by(discount) |&gt; \n  dplyr::summarize(\"sales_per_visit\" = mean(sales_per_visit)) \nmean_sales_pv\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  discount sales_per_visit\n     &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        0           0.861\n2        1           0.938\n\n\n\n\nThe mean value is higher for the discount group. As always, they also looked at the distributions:\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sales_per_visit, after_stat(count), fill = discount)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.30, position = 'identity', color=\"#e9ecef\", bins = 30)+\n  # geom_density(alpha = 0.30) +\n  xlab(\"Sales per Visit\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both data scientists A & B the results look much better, but they were unsure about which uplift to report. They thought about the difference in means:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\nmean_sales_per_visit &lt;- data |&gt; dplyr::group_by(discount) |&gt; \n  dplyr::summarize(\"mean sales per visit\" = mean(sales_per_visit)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\"mean sales difference\" = `mean sales per visit` - dplyr::lag(`mean sales per visit`))\n\nmean_sales_per_visit |&gt; \n  gt::gt() |&gt; \n  gt::tab_header(title = \"Mean sales per visit\") |&gt; \n  gt::fmt_number(columns = `mean sales difference`, decimals = 5) |&gt; \n  gtExtras::gt_theme_espn()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean sales per visit\n\n\ndiscount\nmean sales per visit\nmean sales difference\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.8612426\nNA\n\n\n1\n0.9382929\n0.07705\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, how to interpret this value in terms of dollars?

What if we can observe the unobservables?\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nNow repeat the modeling of exercise 4, but assuming that the formerly unobservable variables are now observable, and so can be included in the linear regression models.\nWhich model returns the (approximately) correct dependence of demand on price, as given in the data generation process?\nWhat can you conclude from these two exercises?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\n# fit the model with dat0\nlm(demand0 ~ price0 + unobserved0, data = dat0) %&gt;% \n  # pull out the coefficient estimates as a tibble\n  broom::tidy() %&gt;% \n  # combine with another table\n  dplyr::bind_rows(\n    # fit the model with dat1\n    lm(demand1 ~ price1 + unobserved1, data = dat1) %&gt;% \n      broom::tidy()\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   18.9      0.710      26.6  1.33e- 97\n2 price0        -0.878    0.0351    -25.0  9.06e- 90\n3 unobserved0    0.497    0.0267     18.6  4.29e- 59\n4 (Intercept)   22.4      0.443      50.5  1.10e-197\n5 price1        -0.443    0.0444     -9.98 1.74e- 21\n6 unobserved1   -1.08     0.0638    -17.0  3.21e- 51\n\n\nWhen we include the formerly unobserved variables we find that\n\nagain the coefficients of price are similar between the models, but\nnow the coefficient of price1 is correct (should be -0.5) while the coefficient of price0 is not (should be -1.0)\n\nThe conclusion is that whether a covariate is included or not requires thinking about the data generation process. We generally only have the observations, but not the exact process that produced them, but we can hypothesize the process and test the conclusions.\nCould adding more data improve our estimates? It depends.\nIn dataset dat1, the unobserved variable affects the values of both price1 and demand1, which adds a correlation to the relationship between price1 and demand1 that is in addition to their direct relationship (with price1 coefficient -0.5). Because of this, the unobserved variable needs to be included in the regression, to control for it and remove the bias due the extra correlation.\nBy contrast, in dataset dat0, the unobserved variable depends on the values of both price0 and demand0, and there is no correlation when this variable is not included in the regression, which estimates the price0 coefficient correctly as -1.0. But if the unobserved variable is included in the regression, because a regression estimate is ‘with all other variables held constant,’ this induces a new correlation between price0 and demand0, exactly because they both affect the unobserved variable - with a fixed value for the unobserved variable, price0 and demand0 are no longer independent. This additional correlation creates the bias in our estimate of the coefficient of price0.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nFor the next several exercises, we’ll work with a new dataset.

    "text": "The traditional go-to tool for causal inference is multiple regression: Yi=δDi+Xi′β+εi,\nY_i = \\delta D_i + X_i'\\beta+\\varepsilon_i,\n where DiD_i is the “treatment” or causal variable whose effects we are interested in, and XiX_i is a vector of controls, conditional on which we are willing to assume DiD_i is as good as randomly assigned.\n\nexample: Suppose we are interested in the magnitude of racial discrimination in the labor market. One way to conceptualize this is the difference in earnings between two workers who are identical in productivity, but differ in their race, or, the “effect” of race. Then DiD_i would be an indicator for, say, a Black worker. YiY_i would be earnings, and XiX_i would be characteristics that capture determinants of productivity, including educational attainment, cognitive ability, and other background characteristics.\n\nWhere does machine learning fit into causal inference? It might be tempting to treat this regression as a prediction exercise where we are predicting YiY_{i} given DiD_{i} and XiX_{i}. Don’t give in to this temptation. We are not after a prediction for YiY_{i}, we are after a coefficient on DiD_{i}. Modern machine learning algorithms are finely tuned for producing predictions, but along the way they compromise coefficients. So how can we deploy machine learning in the service of estimating the causal coefficient δ\\delta?\nTo see where ML fits in, first remember that an equivalent way to estimate δ\\delta is the following three-step procedure:\n\nRegress YiY_{i} on XiX_{i} and compute the residuals, Ỹ\\tilde{Y}% _{i}=Y_{i}-\\hat{Y}_{i}^{OLS}, where ŶiOLS=Xi′(X′X)−1X′Y\\hat{Y}_{i}^{OLS}=X_{i}^{\\prime }\\left( X^{\\prime }X\\right) ^{-1}X^{\\prime }Y\nRegress DiD_{i} on XiX_{i} and compute the residuals, D̃\\tilde{D}% _{i}=D_{i}-\\hat{D}_{i}^{OLS}, where D̂iOLS=Xi′(X′X)−1X′D\\hat{D}_{i}^{OLS}=X_{i}^{\\prime }\\left( X^{\\prime }X\\right) ^{-1}X^{\\prime }D\nRegress Ỹi\\tilde{Y}_{i} on D̃i\\tilde{D}_{i}.\n\nSteps 1 and 2 are prediction exercises–ML’s wheelhouse. When OLS isn’t the right tool for the job, we can replace OLS in those steps with machine learning:\n\nPredict YiY_{i} based on XiX_{i} using ML and compute the residuals, Ỹ\\tilde{Y}% _{i}=Y_{i}-\\hat{Y}_{i}^{ML}, where ŶiML\\hat{Y}_{i}^{ML} is the prediction from an ML algorithm\nPredict DiD_{i} based on XiX_{i} using ML and compute the residuals, D̃\\tilde{D}% _{i}=D_{i}-\\hat{D}_{i}^{ML}, where D̂iML\\hat{D}_{i}^{ML} is the prediction from an ML algorithm\nRegress Ỹi\\tilde{Y}_{i} on D̃i\\tilde{D}_{i}.\n\nThis is the basis for the two major methods we’ll look at today: The first is “Post-Double Selection Lasso” (Belloni, Chernozhukov, Hansen). The second is “Double-Debiased Machine Learning” (Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, Newey, Robins)"

Use filter() and select() to quickly identify only those pieces of information that we care about.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\n# filter to use only rows where teamID equals \"NYN\"\nmets &lt;- Teams  %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(teamID == \"NYN\")\n# filter to use only rows where yearID is &gt;= 2004 and &lt;= 2012\n# you could also write dplyr::filter(yearID  %in% 2004:2012)\nmy_mets &lt;- mets %&gt;% \n  dplyr::filter(yearID &gt;= 2004 & yearID &lt;= 2012)\n# the dataset needs to have at least the year and the won (W) loss (L) record for that year\nmy_mets %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(teamID,yearID,W,L)\n\n  teamID yearID  W  L\n1    NYN   2004 71 91\n2    NYN   2005 83 79\n3    NYN   2006 97 65\n4    NYN   2007 88 74\n5    NYN   2008 89 73\n6    NYN   2009 70 92\n7    NYN   2010 79 83\n8    NYN   2011 77 85\n9    NYN   2012 74 88\n\n\nOverall, the won-loss record was as follows:\n\nmy_mets %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(teamID,yearID,W,L) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::summarize(\n    \"2004-2012 wins\" = sum(W)\n    , \"2004-2012 losses\" = sum(L)\n  )\n\n  2004-2012 wins 2004-2012 losses\n1            728              730\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\nThe model estimates the expected winning percentage as follows:\nŴpct=11+(RARS)2\n\\hat{\\text{W}}_{\\text{pct}}=\\frac{1}{1+\\left(\\frac{\\text{RA}}{\\text{RS}}\\right)^{2}}\n\nwhere RA\\text{RA} is the number of runs the team allows to be scored, RS\\text{RS} is the number of runs that the team scores, and Ŵpct\\hat{\\text{W}}_{\\text{pct}} is the team’s expected winning percentage. The runs scored and allowed are present in the Teams table, so we start by selecting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\nmets_ben &lt;- Teams |&gt;\n  # select to get the columns you want\n  dplyr::select(teamID, yearID, W, L, R, RA) |&gt;\n  # filter to get the rows you want\n  dplyr::filter(teamID == \"NYN\" & yearID %in% 2004:2012)\n\nThe column name can be changed with the dplyr::rename function (Use new_name = old_name to rename selected variables). Alternatively, you can rename the column directly in the select statement above, like this:\ndplyr::select(teamID,yearID,W,L,RS = R,RA)\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  dplyr::rename(RS = R)    # new name = old name\nmets_ben\n\n  teamID yearID  W  L  RS  RA\n1    NYN   2004 71 91 684 731\n2    NYN   2005 83 79 722 648\n3    NYN   2006 97 65 834 731\n4    NYN   2007 88 74 804 750\n5    NYN   2008 89 73 799 715\n6    NYN   2009 70 92 671 757\n7    NYN   2010 79 83 656 652\n8    NYN   2011 77 85 718 742\n9    NYN   2012 74 88 650 709\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\nNext, we need to compute the team’s actual winning percentage in each of these seasons. Thus, we need to add a new column to our data frame, and we do this with the mutate() command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  # once we have the data, we mutate to add a new value (column), using the formula\n  dplyr::mutate( WPct = 1/(1 + (RA/RS)^2 ) )\nmets_ben\n\n  teamID yearID  W  L  RS  RA      WPct\n1    NYN   2004 71 91 684 731 0.4668211\n2    NYN   2005 83 79 722 648 0.5538575\n3    NYN   2006 97 65 834 731 0.5655308\n4    NYN   2007 88 74 804 750 0.5347071\n5    NYN   2008 89 73 799 715 0.5553119\n6    NYN   2009 70 92 671 757 0.4399936\n7    NYN   2010 79 83 656 652 0.5030581\n8    NYN   2011 77 85 718 742 0.4835661\n9    NYN   2012 74 88 650 709 0.4566674\n\n\n\n\nThe expected number of wins is then equal to the product of the expected winning percentage times the number of games.\n\nmets_ben &lt;- mets_ben |&gt;\n  # once we have calculated the expected winning percentage,\n  # the expected number of wins is the percentage times the total number of games played\n  dplyr::mutate( W_hat = WPct * (W+L) )\nmets_ben\n\n  teamID yearID  W  L  RS  RA      WPct    W_hat\n1    NYN   2004 71 91 684 731 0.4668211 75.62501\n2    NYN   2005 83 79 722 648 0.5538575 89.72491\n3    NYN   2006 97 65 834 731 0.5655308 91.61600\n4    NYN   2007 88 74 804 750 0.5347071 86.62255\n5    NYN   2008 89 73 799 715 0.5553119 89.96053\n6    NYN   2009 70 92 671 757 0.4399936 71.27896\n7    NYN   2010 79 83 656 652 0.5030581 81.49541\n8    NYN   2011 77 85 718 742 0.4835661 78.33771\n9    NYN   2012 74 88 650 709 0.4566674 73.98012\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\nIn this case, the Mets’ fortunes were better than expected in three of these seasons, and worse than expected in the other six.\nWe can confirm this as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\nmets_ben %&gt;% \n  # first check that the assertion above is correct\n  dplyr::summarize('better then expected' = sum(W &gt;= W_hat), 'worse than expected' = sum(W &lt; W_hat))\n\n  better then expected worse than expected\n1                    3                   6\n\n\nTo see how the Mets did over all seasons we can repeat our calculation\n\nTeams |&gt;\n  # here we repeat our prior calculation (all steps combined) for all the years in the dataset\n  dplyr::select(teamID, yearID, W, L, RS = R, RA) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(teamID == \"NYN\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate( \n    WPct = 1/(1 + (RA/RS)^2 )\n    , W_hat = WPct * (W+L)\n  )  |&gt; \ndplyr::summarize( \n  \"better then expected\" = sum(W &gt;= W_hat)\n  , 'worse than expected' = sum(W &lt; W_hat) \n)\n\n  better then expected worse than expected\n1                   22                  39\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\nNaturally, the Mets experienced ups and downs during Ben’s time with the team. Which seasons were best? To figure this out, we can simply sort the rows of the data frame by number of wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSOLUTION:\n\n\n\n\n# for this we just need to sort the number of wins in descending order\nmets_ben |&gt; dplyr::arrange(desc(W))\n\n  teamID yearID  W  L  RS  RA      WPct    W_hat\n1    NYN   2006 97 65 834 731 0.5655308 91.61600\n2    NYN   2008 89 73 799 715 0.5553119 89.96053\n3    NYN   2007 88 74 804 750 0.5347071 86.62255\n4    NYN   2005 83 79 722 648 0.5538575 89.72491\n5    NYN   2010 79 83 656 652 0.5030581 81.49541\n6    NYN   2011 77 85 718 742 0.4835661 78.33771\n7    NYN   2012 74 88 650 709 0.4566674 73.98012\n8    NYN   2004 71 91 684 731 0.4668211 75.62501\n9    NYN   2009 70 92 671 757 0.4399936 71.27896\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\nIn 2006, the Mets had the best record in baseball during the regular season and nearly made the World Series.

The company is growing fast and the marketing team is looking for ways to increase the sales from existing customers by making them buy more. The main idea is to unlock the potential of the customer base through incentives, in this case a discount. We of course want to measure the effect of the discount on the customer’s behavior. Still, they do not want to waste money giving discounts to users which are not valuable. As always, it is about return on investment (ROI).\nWithout going into specifics about the nature of the discount, it has been designed to provide a positive return on investment if the customer buys more than $1\\$ 1 as a result of the discount. How can we measure the effect of the discount and make sure our experiment has a positive ROI? The marketing team came up with the following strategy:\n\nSelect a sample of existing customers from the same cohort.\nSet a test window of 1 month.\nLook into the historical data of web visits from the last month. The hypothesis is that web visits are a good proxy for the customer’s interest in the product.\nFor customers with a high number of web visits, send them a discount. There will be a hold out group which will not receive the discount within the potential valuable customers based on the number of web visits. For customers with a low number of web visits, do not send them a discount (the marketing team wants to report a positive ROI, so they do not want to waste money on customers which are not valuable). Still, they want to use them to measure the effect of the discount.\nWe also want to use the results of the test to tag loyal customers. These are customers which got a discount (since they showed potential interest in the product) and customers with exceptional sales numbers even if they did not get a discount. The idea is to use this information to target them in the future if the discount strategy is positive.\n\nIn the last lab we did some exploratory data analysis. The next step is to prepare some descriptive statistics.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\nThe first thing the data analytics team did was to split the sales distribution by discount group:\n\ndata &lt;- readr::read_csv('data/sales_dag.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sales, after_stat(count), fill = discount)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.30, position = 'identity', color=\"#e9ecef\", bins = 30)+\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.30) +\n  xlab(\"Sales\") +\n  ylab(\"Density\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks customers with a discount have higher sales. Data scientist A is optimistic with this initial result. To quantify this, compute the difference in means by discount:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\ngroup by discount and find the difference in means:\nWhat is the difference in means?\n\n\nThe discount strategy seems to be working. Data scientist A is happy with the results and decides to get feedback from the rest of the data science team.\nData scientist B is not so happy with the results. They think that the uplift is too good to be true (based on domain knowledge and the sales distributions 🤔). When thinking about reasons for such a high uplift, they realized the discount assignment was not at random. It was based on the number of web visits (remember the marketing plan?). This means that the discount group is not comparable to the control group completely! They decide to plot sales against web visits per discount group:\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=visits, y = sales, color = discount)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  facet_grid(cols = vars(discount))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndeed, they realize they should probably adjust for the number of web visits. A natural metric is sales per web visit. Compute the sales per visit for each discount group:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean value is higher for the discount group. As always, they also looked at the distributions:\n\ndata |&gt; dplyr::mutate(discount = factor(discount)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sales_per_visit, after_stat(count), fill = discount)) +\n  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.30, position = 'identity', color=\"#e9ecef\", bins = 30)+\n  # geom_density(alpha = 0.30) +\n  xlab(\"Sales per Visit\") +\n  ylab(\"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor both data scientists A & B the results look much better, but they were unsure about which uplift to report. They thought about the difference in means:\nCompute the difference in mean sales_per_visit by discount:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR ANSWER:\n\n\n\nCan you see a way to interpret this in terms of dollars? yes/no\n\n\n\nYou’re done and ready to submit your work!

Raising the threshold has the opposite effect.\nNaive Bayes assumes that all features are conditionally independent, given the class label. This assumption is often unrealistic in real-world data, hence the term “naive.”\nA small ‘k’ can make k-NN sensitive to noise (overfitting), while a large ‘k’ can oversmooth the decision boundary (underfitting). The optimal ‘k’ depends on the dataset and is typically found through cross-validation.\nThe margin in SVM is the distance between the separating hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) of each class. Maximizing the margin aims to improve the classifier’s generalization ability and reduce overfitting.\nThe Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel is commonly used for non-linear classification problems. The polynomial kernel maps data into a higher-dimensional space and can model non-linear relationships between features.\nThe curse of dimensionality refers to the phenomenon where distances between points become less meaningful as the number of dimensions increases. In high-dimensional spaces, k-NN can struggle to find meaningful nearest neighbors.\nClassification is a supervised learning task where the goal is to predict predefined labels for data points. Clustering is an unsupervised learning task where the goal is to discover natural groupings or structures in data without predefined labels.\nThe k-means algorithm initializes ‘k’ centroids randomly. Then, it iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest centroid and recalculates the centroids until convergence (centroids no longer change significantly).\n\nEssay Questions\n\nCompare and contrast eager learning and lazy learning algorithms for classification. Discuss their strengths, weaknesses, and situations where one might be preferred over the other.\nExplain the concepts of precision and recall in the context of binary classification. Discuss how these metrics are affected by changes in the classification threshold and provide examples of applications where each metric might be prioritized.\nDescribe the Naive Bayes classification algorithm in detail, including its underlying assumptions and the calculation of conditional probabilities. Discuss its advantages, limitations, and potential applications.\nExplain the workings of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for classification. Describe the concepts of support vectors, margins, and kernel functions. Compare and contrast linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels in SVM.\n\n\n\nBack to course schedule ⏎",

    "text": "Perform\n⌨️ Lab 3 - Regression Methods\n⌨️ Example 1: grouped data & weighted regression\nFrom Section 10.8 of Regression and Other Stories:\n\nThree models leading to weighted regression\nWeighted least squares can be derived from three different models:\n\nUsing observed data to represent a larger population. This is the most common way that regression weights are used in practice. A weighted regression is fit to sample data in order to estimate the (unweighted) linear model that would be obtained if it could be fit to the entire population. For example, suppose our data come from a survey that oversamples older white women, and we are interested in estimating the population regression. Then we would assign to survey respondent a weight that is proportional to the number of people of that type in the population represented by that person in the sample. In this example, men, younger people, and members of ethnic minorities would have higher weights. Including these weights in the regression is a way to approximately minimize the sum of squared errors with respect to the population rather than the sample.\nDuplicate observations. More directly, suppose each data point can represent one or more actual observations, so that i represents a collection of w_i data points, all of which happen to have x_i as their vector of predictors, and where y_i is the average of the corresponding wi outcome variables. Then weighted regression on the compressed dataset, (x, y, w), is equivalent to unweighted regression on the original data.\nUnequal variances. From a completely different direction, weighted least squares is the maximum likelihood estimate for the regression model with independent normally distributed errors with unequal variances, where sd(ε_i) is proportional to 1/√w_i . That is, measurements with higher variance get lower weight when fitting the model. As discussed further in Section 11.1, unequal variances are not typically a major issue for the goal of estimating regression coefficients, but they become more important when making predictions about individual cases.\n\nWe will use weighted regression later in the course (Lectures 7 & 8), using observed data to represent a larger population - case 1 above.\nHere’s an example of the second case:\n\n# check if 'librarian' is installed and if not, install it\nif (! \"librarian\" %in% rownames(installed.packages()) ){\n  install.packages(\"librarian\")\n}\n  \n# load packages if not already loaded\nlibrarian::shelf(dplyr, broom)\n\n\n  The 'cran_repo' argument in shelf() was not set, so it will use\n  cran_repo = 'https://cran.r-project.org' by default.\n\n  To avoid this message, set the 'cran_repo' argument to a CRAN\n  mirror URL (see https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) or set\n  'quiet = TRUE'.\n\nset.seed(1024)\n\n# individual (true) dataset, with 100,000 rows\nx &lt;- round(rnorm(1e5))\ny &lt;- round(x + x^2 + rnorm(1e5))\nind &lt;- data.frame(x, y)\n\n# aggregated dataset: grouped\nagg &lt;- ind %&gt;%\n  dplyr::group_by(x, y) |&gt; \n  dplyr::summarize(freq = dplyr::n(), .groups = 'drop') \n\nmodels &lt;- list( \n  \"True\"                = lm(y ~ x, data = ind),\n  \"Aggregated\"          = lm(y ~ x, data = agg),\n  \"Aggregated & W\"      = lm(y ~ x, data = agg, weights=freq)\n)\n\nmodels[['True']] |&gt; broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)     1.08   0.00580      187.       0    1.07       1.10\n2 x               1.01   0.00558      181.       0    0.998      1.02\n\nmodels[['Aggregated']] |&gt; broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    5.51      0.717      7.69 8.74e-11    4.08       6.95\n2 x              0.910     0.302      3.01 3.69e- 3    0.306      1.51\n\nmodels[['Aggregated & W']] |&gt; broom::tidy(conf.int = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic    p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)     1.08     0.224      4.84 0.00000795    0.637      1.53\n2 x               1.01     0.216      4.68 0.0000145     0.579      1.44\n\n\nNote the differences in the coefficient estimate for xx and the corresponding standard errors.\n\n\nBack to course schedule ⏎",

    "section": "Part 2 - GDP and Urban population",
    "text": "Part 2 - GDP and Urban population\nData on countries’ Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and percentage of urban population was collected and made available by The World Bank in 2020. A description of the variables as defined by The World Bank are provided below.\n\nGDP: “GDP per capita is gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in current U.S. dollars.”\nUrban Population (% of total): “Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. It is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.”\n\nThe data can be found in the data folder of your repository. Read the data and name it gdp_2020.\n\nFit a model predicting GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the linear model seem appropriate for modeling this relationship? Explain your reasoning.\nAdd a new column to the gdp_2020 dataset called gdp_log which is the (natural) log of gdp.\nFit a new model, predicting the log of GDP from urban population. Then make a plot of residuals vs. fitted for this model. Does the model predicting logged GDP or original GDP appear to be a better fit? Explain your reasoning.\n\nThe model output for predicting logged GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n6.107\n0.202\n30.291\n0\n\n\nurban\n0.042\n0.003\n13.769\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear model for predicting log of GDP can be expressed as follows:\nlog(GDP)̂=6.11+0.042×urban\n\\widehat{\\log(GDP)} = 6.11 + 0.042 \\times urban\n\nTherefore, the coefficient of urban (0.042) can be interpreted as the change in logged GDP associated with 1 percentage point increase in urban population. The problem is, logged GDP is not a very informative value to talk about. So we need to undo the transformation we’ve done.\nTo do so, let’s do a quick review of some properties of logs.\n\nSubtraction and logs: log(a)−log(b)=log(ab)log(a) − log(b) = log(\\frac{a}{b})\nNatural logarithm: elog(x)=xe^{log(x)} = x\n\nBased on the interpretation of the slope above, the difference between the predicted values of logged GDP for a given value of urban and a value that is 1 percentage point higher is 0.0425. Let’s write this out mathematically, and then use the properties we’ve listed above to work through the equation.\nlog(GDP for urban x+1)−log(GDP for urban x)=0.042log(GDP for urban x+1GDP for urban x)=0.042elog(GDP for urban x+1GDP for urban x)=e0.042GDP for urban x+1GDP for urban x=e0.042\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog(\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1) - log(\\text{GDP for urban } x) &= 0.042 \\\\\nlog\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big) &= 0.042 \\\\\ne^{log\\Big( \\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} \\Big)} &= e^{0.042}\\\\\n\\frac{\\text{GDP for urban } x + 1}{\\text{GDP for urban } x} &= e^{0.042}\n\\end{aligned}\n\n\nBased on the derivation above, fill in the blanks in the following sentence for an alternative (and more useful interpretation) of the slope of urban.\n\nFor each additional percentage point the urban population is higher, the GDP of a country is expected to be ___, on average, by a factor of ___."

    "text": "Exercises\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in-person voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is “Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?”\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Counties in North Carolina\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus on counties in North Carolina. We will use the data sets election_nc and county_map_data.\n\nVisualize the distribution of the response variable inperson_pct and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\nLet’s view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of North Carolina with the color of each county filled in based on the percentage of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election. Fill in title and axis labels.\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\nWhat are 2 - 3 observations you have from the plot?\nWhat is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn’t apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise?

Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nWrite the regression equation using mathematical notation.\n\nNow let’s use the model coefficients to describe the relationship.\n\nInterpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\nDoes it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\nIf the linear model is a good fit to these data, there should be no structure left in the residuals and the residuals should have constant variance. Augment the data with the model to obtain the residuals and predicted values for each observation, and call the augmented data frame nc_election_aug (You will use this name in Exercise 8). Then, make a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values, and based on this plot, and provide a brief explanation for whether these two conditions are met. Hint: Zoom out on the plot by extending the limits of the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven’t done so recently and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe might also be interested in our observations being independent, particularly if we are to use these data for inference. To evaluate whether the independence condition is met, we will examine a map of the counties in North Carolina with the color filled based on the value of the residuals.\n\nBriefly explain why we may want to view the residuals on a map to assess independence.\nBriefly explain what pattern (if any) we would expect to observe on the map if the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nFill in the name of your model in the code below to calculate the residuals and add them to election_map_data. Then, a map with the color of each county filled in based on the value of the residual. Hint: Start with the code from Exercise 2.\nIs the independence condition satisfied?

This data is in the election_sample data frame. Because these counties were randomly selected out of the 3,006 counties in the United States, we can reasonably treat the counties as independent observations.\n\nFit the linear model to these sample data to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope using a permutation test. In your response, state the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and state the conclusion in the context of the data.\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\nComment on whether the hypothesis test and confidence interval support the general consensus that Republican voters were more likely to vote in-person in the 2020 election? A brief explanation is sufficient but it should be based on your conclusions from Exercises 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates."

For example, if you have a dataset where 50% of the samples are class A and 50% are class B, accuracy is a good measure of whether the model correctly predicts the classes.\nGeneral Performance: For an overall sense of a model’s performance, accuracy provides a straightforward, easy-to-understand measure, giving the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccuracy has several limitations, especially in the context of imbalanced datasets:\n\n\nImbalanceImportanceBehaviour\n\n\n\nImbalanced Datasets:\n\nFalse Sense of Performance: When one class significantly outnumbers the other, accuracy can be misleading: if 95% of the samples belong to class A and only 5% to class B, always predicting class A will have a high accuracy (95%) but may fail to correctly identify any instances of class B.\n\n\n\n\n\nIgnoring Class Importance:\n\nPrecision and Recall: Accuracy does not take into account the importance of different classes or the costs of different types of errors (false positives and false negatives). In many business contexts, these costs are not equal, e.g., in medical diagnosis, a false -ve might be much more serious than a false +ve.\n\n\n\n\n\nLack of Insight into Model Behavior:\n\nDetailed Performance: Accuracy give no insight into the types of errors the model is making. Precision and recall, on the other hand, offer more detailed information about the performance on individual classes - crucial for understanding and improving the model."

Common techniques include Min-Max scaling (to a [0, 1] range) and StandardScaler (to zero mean and unit variance).\n\nb.

The centroid of each cluster is computed, and these are used as the initial centers. This approach is implemented in the Hartigan-Wong method.\nk-means++: Beginning with one random set of the observations, further observations are sampled via probability-weighted sampling until \\(k\\) clusters are formed. The centroids of these clusters are used as the initial centers."

Think of these as new axes in a new coordinate system that best capture the variation in the data.\nThe first principal component captures the most variation. The second principal component is orthogonal (at a right angle) to the first and captures the next most variation, and so on.\n\nTransform the Data:\n\nWe then transform the original data into this new set of principal components.

    "section": "Ridge Regression",
    "text": "Ridge Regression\nFrom the discussion so far we have concluded that we would like to decrease the model complexity, that is the number of predictors. We could use the forward or backward selection for this, but that way we would not be able to tell anything about the removed variables’ effect on the response. Removing predictors from the model can be seen as settings their coefficients to zero. Instead of forcing them to be exactly zero, let’s penalize them if they are too far from zero, thus enforcing them to be small in a continuous way. This way, we decrease model complexity while keeping all variables in the model. This, basically, is what Ridge Regression does.\n\nModel Specification\nIn Ridge Regression, the OLS loss function is augmented in such a way that we not only minimize the sum of squared residuals but also penalize the size of parameter estimates, in order to shrink them towards zero:\nLridge(β̂)=∑i=1n(yi−xi′β̂)2+λ∑j=1mβ̂j2=‖y−Xβ̂‖2+λ‖β̂‖2\n\\text{L}_{ridge}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-x_{i}^{'}\\hat{\\beta}\\right)^{2} + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\hat{\\beta}^2_j=\\left\\Vert y-X\\hat{\\beta}\\right\\Vert ^{2} + \\lambda\\left\\Vert \\hat{\\beta}\\right\\Vert ^{2}\n\nSolving this for β̂\\hat\\beta gives the the ridge regression estimates β̂ridge=(X′X+λI)−1(X′Y)\\hat\\beta_{ridge} = (X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}(X'Y), where I denotes the identity matrix.\nThe λ\\lambda parameter is the regularization penalty. We will talk about how to choose it in the next sections of this tutorial, but for now notice that:\n\nAs λ→0,β̂ridge→β̂OLS\\lambda \\rightarrow 0, \\quad \\hat\\beta_{ridge} \\rightarrow \\hat\\beta_{OLS};\nAs λ→∞,β̂ridge→0\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty, \\quad \\hat\\beta_{ridge} \\rightarrow 0.\n\nSo, setting λ\\lambda to 0 is the same as using the OLS, while the larger its value, the stronger is the coefficients’ size penalized.\n\n\nBias-Variance Trade-Off in Ridge Regression\nBias(𝛃̂ridge)=λ(X′X+λI)−1βVar(𝛃̂ridge)=σ2(X′X+λI)−1X′X(X′X+λI)−1\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{ridge}\\right) & =\\lambda(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}\\beta\\\\\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{ridge}\\right) & =\\sigma^{2}(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}X'X(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom there you can see that as λ\\lambda becomes larger, the variance decreases, and the bias increases. This poses the question: how much bias are we willing to accept in order to decrease the variance? Or: what is the optimal value for λ\\lambda?\nThere are two ways we could tackle this issue. A more traditional approach would be to choose λ such that some information criterion, e.g., AIC or BIC, is the smallest. A more machine learning-like approach is to perform cross-validation and select the value of λ that minimizes the cross-validated sum of squared residuals (or some other measure). The former approach emphasizes the model’s fit to the data, while the latter is more focused on its predictive performance. Let’s discuss both.\n\n\nMinimizing Information Criteria\nThis approach boils down to estimating the model with many different values for λ\\lambda and choosing the one that minimizes the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion:\nAICridge=log(e′e)+2dfridgeBICridge=log(e′e)+2dfridgelogn\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{AIC}_{\\text{ridge}} & =\\log(e'e)+2\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}\\\\\n\\text{BIC}_{\\text{ridge}} & =\\log(e'e)+2\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}\\log n\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere dfridge\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}} is the number of degrees of freedom. Watch out here! The number of degrees of freedom in ridge regression is different than in the regular OLS! This is often overlooked which leads to incorrect inference. In both OLS and ridge regression, degrees of freedom are equal to the trace of the so-called hat matrix, which is a matrix that maps the vector of response values to the vector of fitted values as follows: ŷ=Hy\\hat y = H y.\nIn OLS, we find that HOLS=X(X′X)−1X\\text{H}_{\\text{OLS}}=X(X′X)^{−1}X, which gives dfOLS=trHOLS=m\\text{df}_{\\text{OLS}}=\\text{tr}\\text{H}_{\\text{OLS}}=m, where mm is the number of predictor variables. In ridge regression, however, the formula for the hat matrix should include the regularization penalty: Hridge=X(X′X+λI)−1X\\text{H}_{\\text{ridge}}=X(X′X+\\lambda I)^{−1}X, which gives dfridge=trHridge\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}=\\text{tr}\\text{H}_{\\text{ridge}}, which is no longer equal to mm. Some ridge regression software produce information criteria based on the OLS formula. To be sure you are doing things right, it is safer to compute them manually, which is what we will do later in this tutorial.\n\n\nRidge Regression: R example\nIn R, the glmnet package contains all you need to implement ridge regression. We will use the infamous mtcars dataset as an illustration, where the task is to predict miles per gallon based on car’s other characteristics. One more thing: ridge regression assumes the predictors are standardized and the response is centered! You will see why this assumption is needed in a moment. For now, we will just standardize before modeling.\n\n# Load libraries, get data & set seed for reproducibility ---------------------\nset.seed(123)    # seef for reproducibility\nlibrary(glmnet)  # for ridge regression\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for data cleaning\nlibrary(psych)   # for function tr() to compute trace of a matrix\n\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n# Center y, X will be standardized in the modelling function\ny &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% select(mpg) %&gt;% scale(center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) %&gt;% as.matrix()\nX &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% select(-mpg) %&gt;% as.matrix()\n\n\n# Perform 10-fold cross-validation to select lambda ---------------------------\nlambdas_to_try &lt;- 10^seq(-3, 5, length.out = 100)\n# Setting alpha = 0 implements ridge regression\nridge_cv &lt;- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0, lambda = lambdas_to_try,\n                      standardize = TRUE, nfolds = 10)\n# Plot cross-validation results\nplot(ridge_cv)",

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe PCA material here is taken from Probabilistic View of Principal Component Analysis\nWe’ll assume all columns in our data have been normalized - with zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\nFor any square matrix AA, xx is an eigenvector of AA and λ\\lambda the corresponding eigenvalue of AA if Ax=λxAx=\\lambda x. Suppose AA has a full set of NN independent eigenvectors (most matrices do, but not all).\nIf we put the eigenvectors into a matrix QQ (the eigenvectors are the column vectors of the matrix), then AQ=QΛAQ=Q\\Lambda, where Λ\\Lambda is a diagonal matrix, with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Thus\nA=QΛQ−1=QΛQ⊤(1)\nA = Q\\Lambda Q^{-1} =  Q\\Lambda Q^\\top\n \\qquad(1)\nThis is the Eigenvalue Decomposition: a square N×NN\\times N matrix (AA) which is diagonalizable can be factorized as:\nA=QΛQ⊤\nA = Q\\Lambda Q^\\top \n\nwhere QQ is the square N×NN\\times N matrix whose iith column is the eigenvector qiq_i of BB, and Λ\\Lambda is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues. QQ is square and orthogonal (Q=Q−1=Q⊤Q=Q^{-1}=Q^\\top), because the eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\n\n\nIf AA is not square we need a different decomposition. Suppose AA is an N×DN\\times D matrix (NN rows and DD columns) - then we need a square, orthogonal N×NN\\times N matrix VV to multiply on the right, and a square, orthogonal D×DD\\times D matrix UU to multiply on the left. In which case our matrix (say A) can be factorized as:\nA=UΣV⊤(2)\nA = U\\Sigma V^\\top \n \\qquad(2)\nΣ\\Sigma will then be an N×DN\\times D matrix where the D×DD\\times D subset will be diagonal with rr singular values σii∈{1,2,…,r}\\sigma_i\\;i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,r\\} and the remaining entries will be zero.\nWe have\nA=UΣV⊤=σ1u1v1⊤+σ2u2v2⊤+…+σrurvr⊤\nA = U\\Sigma V^\\top =\\sigma_1u_1v_1^\\top + \\sigma_2u_2v_2^\\top + \\ldots+\\sigma_ru_rv_r^\\top\n Note that this is a sum of matrices. The first is the best rank 1 approximation to AA; the first kk is the best rank kk approximation to AA\n\n\n\nThe PCA decomposition requires that one compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of AA (again an N×DN\\times D matrix), which is the product 1n−1AA⊤\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top. Since the covariance matrix is symmetric, the matrix is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors can be normalized such that they are orthonormal.\nThe square corvariance matrix (1n−1AA⊤\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top) is symmetric and thus diagonizable, and so from equation (Equation 1), it can be factorized as:\n1n−1AA⊤=QΛQ⊤\n\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top = Q\\Lambda Q^\\top \n where Λ\\Lambda is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and QQ has column vectors that are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\nHowever, using the SVD (Equation 2) we can also write\n1n−1AA⊤=1n−1(UΣV⊤)(VΣU⊤)=UΣ2U⊤\n\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(U\\Sigma V^\\top\\right)\\left(V\\Sigma U^\\top\\right) = U\\Sigma^2U^\\top\n\nUsing the SVD to perform PCA makes much better sense numerically than forming the covariance matrix to begin with, since the formation of AA⊤AA^\\top can cause loss of precision.\nHere is a simple PCA example:\n\nDataCorrelationPCA\n\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1) # For data reproducibility\n# create some data\ndat1 &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  x = rnorm(50, 50, sd = 3)\n  , y = .5*x + rnorm(50, sd = sqrt(3))\n)\n# plot it\ndat1 |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(,color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  xlab(\"Variable 1\") +\n  ylab(\"Variable 2\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# center and\ndat1 &lt;- dat1 |&gt;  \n  dplyr::mutate(x = x - mean(x), y = y - mean(y))\n# convert to matrix\ndat2 &lt;- dat1 |&gt; dplyr::select(x,y) |&gt; as.matrix()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate the covariance matrix\ncov_m &lt;- (t(dat2) %*% dat2) / (nrow(dat2) - 1) \ncov_m\n\n         x        y\nx 6.220943 2.946877\ny 2.946877 4.207523\n\n\n\n# we can also use the cov function in base R\ncov(dat2)\n\n         x        y\nx 6.220943 2.946877\ny 2.946877 4.207523\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use eigen() to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues\ncov_e &lt;- eigen(cov_m)\n\n# Eigenvectors\ne_vec &lt;- cov_e$vectors\n\n# Eigenvalues\ne_val &lt;- cov_e$values\n\n# First eigenvector \nev_1 &lt;- e_vec[,1]\n\n# Second eigenvector \nev_2 &lt;- e_vec[,2]\n\n# eigenvectors are orthogonal and eigenvalues capture total variance\nc( ev_1 %*% ev_2, e_val, e_val |&gt; sum(), cov_m |&gt; diag() |&gt; sum())\n\n\n[1] 2.749766e-17 8.328321e+00 2.100145e+00 1.042847e+01 1.042847e+01\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a positive semi-definite matrix SVD and eigendecomposition are equivalent. PCA boils down to the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. Finding the maximum eigenvalue(s) and corresponding eigenvector(s) can be thought of as finding the direction of maximum variance.\nIf we have a lot of data (many rows or many columns or both), we’ll have a large covariance matrix and large number of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors (though there can be duplicates).\nDo we need them all? How many are just due to noise or measurement error?

    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nThe PCA material here is taken from Probabilistic View of Principal Component Analysis\nWe’ll assume all columns in our data have been normalized - with zero mean and unit standard deviation.\n\n\n\n\nFor any square matrix AA, xx is an eigenvector of AA and λ\\lambda the corresponding eigenvalue of AA if Ax=λxAx=\\lambda x. Suppose AA has a full set of NN independent eigenvectors (most matrices do, but not all).\nIf we put the eigenvectors into a matrix QQ (the eigenvectors are the column vectors of the matrix), then AQ=QΛAQ=Q\\Lambda, where Λ\\Lambda is a diagonal matrix, with the eigenvalues on the diagonal. Thus\nA=QΛQ−1=QΛQ⊤(1)\nA = Q\\Lambda Q^{-1} =  Q\\Lambda Q^\\top\n \\qquad(1)\nThis is the Eigenvalue Decomposition: a square N×NN\\times N matrix (AA) which is diagonalizable can be factorized as:\nA=QΛQ⊤\nA = Q\\Lambda Q^\\top \n\nwhere QQ is the square N×NN\\times N matrix whose iith column is the eigenvector qiq_i of BB, and Λ\\Lambda is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the corresponding eigenvalues. QQ is square and orthogonal (Q=Q−1=Q⊤Q=Q^{-1}=Q^\\top), because the eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n\n\n\nIf AA is not square we need a different decomposition. Suppose AA is an N×DN\\times D matrix (NN rows and DD columns) - then we need a square, orthogonal N×NN\\times N matrix VV to multiply on the right, and a square, orthogonal D×DD\\times D matrix UU to multiply on the left. In which case our matrix (say A) can be factorized as:\nA=UΣV⊤(2)\nA = U\\Sigma V^\\top \n \\qquad(2)\nΣ\\Sigma will then be an N×DN\\times D matrix where the D×DD\\times D subset will be diagonal with rr singular values σii∈{1,2,…,r}\\sigma_i\\;i\\in\\{1,2,\\ldots,r\\} and the remaining entries will be zero.\nWe have\nA=UΣV⊤=σ1u1v1⊤+σ2u2v2⊤+…+σrurvr⊤\nA = U\\Sigma V^\\top =\\sigma_1u_1v_1^\\top + \\sigma_2u_2v_2^\\top + \\ldots+\\sigma_ru_rv_r^\\top\n Note that this is a sum of matrices. The first is the best rank 1 approximation to AA; the first kk is the best rank kk approximation to AA\n\n\n\nThe PCA decomposition requires that one compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of AA (again an N×DN\\times D matrix), which is the product 1n−1AA⊤\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top. Since the covariance matrix is symmetric, the matrix is diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors can be normalized such that they are orthonormal.\nThe square corvariance matrix (1n−1AA⊤\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top) is symmetric and thus diagonizable, and so from equation (Equation 1), it can be factorized as:\n1n−1AA⊤=QΛQ⊤\n\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top = Q\\Lambda Q^\\top \n where Λ\\Lambda is the diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and QQ has column vectors that are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.\nHowever, using the SVD (Equation 2) we can also write\n1n−1AA⊤=1n−1(UΣV⊤)(VΣU⊤)=UΣ2U⊤\n\\frac{1}{n-1}AA^\\top = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left(U\\Sigma V^\\top\\right)\\left(V\\Sigma U^\\top\\right) = U\\Sigma^2U^\\top\n\nUsing the SVD to perform PCA makes much better sense numerically than forming the covariance matrix to begin with, since the formation of AA⊤AA^\\top can cause loss of precision.\nHere is a simple PCA example:\n\nDataCorrelationPCA\n\n\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1) # For data reproducibility\n# create some data\ndat1 &lt;- tibble::tibble(\n  x = rnorm(50, 50, sd = 3)\n  , y = .5*x + rnorm(50, sd = sqrt(3))\n)\n# plot it\ndat1 |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point(,color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  xlab(\"Variable 1\") +\n  ylab(\"Variable 2\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# center and\ndat1 &lt;- dat1 |&gt;  \n  dplyr::mutate(x = x - mean(x), y = y - mean(y))\n# convert to matrix\ndat2 &lt;- dat1 |&gt; dplyr::select(x,y) |&gt; as.matrix()\n\n\n\n\n\n# Calculate the covariance matrix\ncov_m &lt;- (t(dat2) %*% dat2) / (nrow(dat2) - 1) \ncov_m\n\n         x        y\nx 6.220943 2.946877\ny 2.946877 4.207523\n\n\n\n# we can also use the cov function in base R\ncov(dat2)\n\n         x        y\nx 6.220943 2.946877\ny 2.946877 4.207523\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Use eigen() to obtain eigenvectors and eigenvalues\ncov_e &lt;- eigen(cov_m)\n\n# Eigenvectors\ne_vec &lt;- cov_e$vectors\n\n# Eigenvalues\ne_val &lt;- cov_e$values\n\n# First eigenvector \nev_1 &lt;- e_vec[,1]\n\n# Second eigenvector \nev_2 &lt;- e_vec[,2]\n\n# eigenvectors are orthogonal and eigenvalues capture total variance\nc( ev_1 %*% ev_2, e_val, e_val |&gt; sum(), cov_m |&gt; diag() |&gt; sum())\n\n\n[1] 2.749766e-17 8.328321e+00 2.100145e+00 1.042847e+01 1.042847e+01\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a positive semi-definite matrix SVD and eigendecomposition are equivalent. PCA boils down to the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix. Finding the maximum eigenvalue(s) and corresponding eigenvector(s) can be thought of as finding the direction of maximum variance.\nIf we have a lot of data (many rows or many columns or both), we’ll have a large covariance matrix and large number of eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors (though there can be duplicates).\nDo we need them all? How many are just due to noise or measurement error? First look at random matrices, then at covariance matrices formed from random matrices.\n\n\n\nLet’s perform an experiment, generating a large random N×NN\\times N data set using N(0,1)N(0,1) measurements.\n\n\neigenvalues from random symmetric matrix (Normally distributed measurements)\nrequire(ggplot2, quietly=TRUE)\n\n# 5000 rows and columns\nn &lt;- 5000\n# generate n^2 samples from N(0,1)\nm &lt;- array( rnorm(n^2) ,c(n,n))\n# make it symmetric\nm2 &lt;- (m + t(m))/sqrt(2*n) # t(m) %*% m\n# compute eigenvalues and vectors\nlambda &lt;- eigen(m2, symmetric=T, only.values = T)\n\n# plot the eignevalues\ntibble::tibble(lambda = lambda$values) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = lambda, y = after_stat(density))) + \n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill=\"lightblue\", bins=100) + \n  labs(x = 'eigenvalues', title = 'Normal random symmetric matrix') +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s do the same, but with uniform U(0,1)U(0,1) distributed measurements.\n\n\neigenvalues from random symmetric matrix (Uniformly distributed measurements)\n# 5000 rows and columns\nn &lt;- 5000\n# generate n^2 samples from U(0,1)\nm &lt;- array( runif(n^2) ,c(n,n))\n# make it symmetric\nm2 &lt;- sqrt(12)*(m + t(m) -1)/sqrt(2*n) # t(m) %*% m\n# compute eigenvalues and vectors\nlambda &lt;- eigen(m2, symmetric=T, only.values = T)\n\n# plot the eignevalues\ntibble::tibble(lambda = lambda$values) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = lambda, y = after_stat(density))) + \n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill=\"lightblue\", bins=100) + \n  labs(x = 'eigenvalues', title = 'Uniform random symmetric matrix') +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote the striking pattern: the density of eigenvalues is a semicircle.\n\n\n\nLet Ã\\tilde{A} be an N×NN\\times N matrix with entries Ãi,j∼𝒩(0,σ2)\\tilde{A}_{i,j}\\sim\\mathcal{N}\\left(0,\\sigma^2\\right).

    "text": "Ridge Regression\nFrom the discussion so far we have concluded that we would like to decrease the model complexity, that is the number of predictors. We could use the forward or backward selection for this, but that way we would not be able to tell anything about the removed variables’ effect on the response. Removing predictors from the model can be seen as settings their coefficients to zero. Instead of forcing them to be exactly zero, let’s penalize them if they are too far from zero, thus enforcing them to be small in a continuous way. This way, we decrease model complexity while keeping all variables in the model. This, basically, is what Ridge Regression does.\n\nModel Specification\nIn Ridge Regression, the OLS loss function is augmented in such a way that we not only minimize the sum of squared residuals but also penalize the size of parameter estimates, in order to shrink them towards zero:\nLridge(β̂)=∑i=1n(yi−xi′β̂)2+λ∑j=1mβ̂j2=‖y−Xβ̂‖2+λ‖β̂‖2\n\\text{L}_{ridge}\\left(\\hat{\\beta}\\right)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(y_{i}-x_{i}^{'}\\hat{\\beta}\\right)^{2} + \\lambda\\sum_{j=1}^{m}\\hat{\\beta}^2_j=\\left\\Vert y-X\\hat{\\beta}\\right\\Vert ^{2} + \\lambda\\left\\Vert \\hat{\\beta}\\right\\Vert ^{2}\n\nSolving this for β̂\\hat\\beta gives the the ridge regression estimates β̂ridge=(X′X+λI)−1(X′Y)\\hat\\beta_{ridge} = (X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}(X'Y), where I denotes the identity matrix.\nThe λ\\lambda parameter is the regularization penalty. We will talk about how to choose it in the next sections of this tutorial, but for now notice that:\n\nAs λ→0,β̂ridge→β̂OLS\\lambda \\rightarrow 0, \\quad \\hat\\beta_{ridge} \\rightarrow \\hat\\beta_{OLS};\nAs λ→∞,β̂ridge→0\\lambda \\rightarrow \\infty, \\quad \\hat\\beta_{ridge} \\rightarrow 0.\n\nSo, setting λ\\lambda to 0 is the same as using the OLS, while the larger its value, the stronger is the coefficients’ size penalized.\n\n\nBias-Variance Trade-Off in Ridge Regression\nBias(𝛃̂ridge)=λ(X′X+λI)−1βVar(𝛃̂ridge)=σ2(X′X+λI)−1X′X(X′X+λI)−1\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Bias}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{ridge}\\right) & =\\lambda(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}\\beta\\\\\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}_{ridge}\\right) & =\\sigma^{2}(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}X'X(X'X+\\lambda I)^{-1}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFrom there you can see that as λ\\lambda becomes larger, the variance decreases, and the bias increases. This poses the question: how much bias are we willing to accept in order to decrease the variance? Or: what is the optimal value for λ\\lambda?\nThere are two ways we could tackle this issue. A more traditional approach would be to choose λ such that some information criterion, e.g., AIC or BIC, is the smallest. A more machine learning-like approach is to perform cross-validation and select the value of λ that minimizes the cross-validated sum of squared residuals (or some other measure). The former approach emphasizes the model’s fit to the data, while the latter is more focused on its predictive performance. Let’s discuss both.\n\n\nMinimizing Information Criteria\nThis approach boils down to estimating the model with many different values for λ\\lambda and choosing the one that minimizes the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion:\nAICridge=log(e′e)+2dfridgeBICridge=log(e′e)+2dfridgelogn\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{AIC}_{\\text{ridge}} & =\\log(e'e)+2\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}\\\\\n\\text{BIC}_{\\text{ridge}} & =\\log(e'e)+2\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}\\log n\n\\end{align*}\n\nwhere dfridge\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}} is the number of degrees of freedom. Watch out here! The number of degrees of freedom in ridge regression is different than in the regular OLS! This is often overlooked which leads to incorrect inference. In both OLS and ridge regression, degrees of freedom are equal to the trace of the so-called hat matrix, which is a matrix that maps the vector of response values to the vector of fitted values as follows: ŷ=Hy\\hat y = H y.\nIn OLS, we find that HOLS=X(X′X)−1X\\text{H}_{\\text{OLS}}=X(X′X)^{−1}X, which gives dfOLS=trHOLS=m\\text{df}_{\\text{OLS}}=\\text{tr}\\text{H}_{\\text{OLS}}=m, where mm is the number of predictor variables. In ridge regression, however, the formula for the hat matrix should include the regularization penalty: Hridge=X(X′X+λI)−1X\\text{H}_{\\text{ridge}}=X(X′X+\\lambda I)^{−1}X, which gives dfridge=trHridge\\text{df}_{\\text{ridge}}=\\text{tr}\\text{H}_{\\text{ridge}}, which is no longer equal to mm. Some ridge regression software produce information criteria based on the OLS formula. To be sure you are doing things right, it is safer to compute them manually, which is what we will do later in this tutorial.\n\n\nRidge Regression: R example\nIn R, the glmnet package contains all you need to implement ridge regression. We will use the infamous mtcars dataset as an illustration, where the task is to predict miles per gallon based on car’s other characteristics. One more thing: ridge regression assumes the predictors are standardized and the response is centered! You will see why this assumption is needed in a moment. For now, we will just standardize before modeling.\n\n# Load libraries, get data & set seed for reproducibility ---------------------\nset.seed(123)    # seef for reproducibility\nlibrary(glmnet)  # for ridge regression\nlibrary(dplyr)   # for data cleaning\nlibrary(psych)   # for function tr() to compute trace of a matrix\n\ndata(\"mtcars\")\n# Center y, X will be standardized in the modelling function\ny &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% select(mpg) %&gt;% scale(center = TRUE, scale = FALSE) %&gt;% as.matrix()\nX &lt;- mtcars %&gt;% select(-mpg) %&gt;% as.matrix()\n\n\n# Perform 10-fold cross-validation to select lambda ---------------------------\nlambdas_to_try &lt;- 10^seq(-3, 5, length.out = 100)\n# Setting alpha = 0 implements ridge regression\nridge_cv &lt;- cv.glmnet(X, y, alpha = 0, lambda = lambdas_to_try,\n                      standardize = TRUE, nfolds = 10)\n# Plot cross-validation results\nplot(ridge_cv)\n\n\nThis document contains the mathematical details for deriving the least-squares estimates for slope (β1\\beta_1) and intercept (β0\\beta_0).

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the Lab?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TA are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the lab. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.3: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install a daily build of RStudio: https://dailies.rstudio.com/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment set up for you in the lab.",

You are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion. Additionally, some lectures will feature [application exercises] that will be graded. In addition to application exercises will be periodic activities help build a learning community.

    "section": "Five tips for success",
    "text": "Five tips for success\nYour success on this course depends very much on you and the effort you put into it. The course has been organized so that the burden of learning is on you. Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions. But if you find yourself falling behind and not knowing where to begin asking, come to office hours, and let me help you identify a good (re)starting point.\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Lou Odette and our head TA TODO before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\nNote: If you’ve read this far in the syllabus, email me a picture of your pet if you have one or your favourite meme!",
