## Congratulations on Completing the Course

-   Before we wrap up though, complete the [Student Perceptions of Teaching](https://ask.uwindsor.ca/app/answers/detail/a_id/176/kw/Student%20perceptions),
-   then make sure you have BRMS installed, and
-   finally, the final exam.

## BRMS

-   Reference materials for BRMS can be found [here](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/index.html) and [here](https://michael-franke.github.io/Bayesian-Regression/practice-sheets/01b-regression-BRMS.html).
-   Instructions for installing BRMS can be found [here](https://learnb4ss.github.io/learnB4SS/articles/install-brms.html) and [here](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/). The basic steps (in order) are
    1.  Configure the C++ toolchain (use RTools in Windows)
    2.  [Install Stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started) and verify the Stan installation
    3.  [Install BRMS](https://paulbuerkner.com/brms/)
